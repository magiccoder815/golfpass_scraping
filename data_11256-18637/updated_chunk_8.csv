At just over 6,684 yards, the classic layout runs a bit shorter than most courses built today. It is a challenging layout but it is also very forgiving, making it more accommodating for beginning and intermediate players. The club has built its longstanding reputation on the player-friendly Ross design and the excellent course conditions, cementing it as one of the area's favorites.

Opened in 1956, the 18-hole course has a traditional layout that is shorter than most modern courses. Despite the relatively short length, there are plenty of challenges in store on this golf course. The greens are severely sloped and they play lightning fast. More often than not, you'll find that they're flanked by strategically placed bunkers as well. There are also water hazards that come into play on several holes. The golf course appeals to a wide range of skill levels since it's not overly punishing for high handicappers and there are risk-reward opportunities for more advanced players. Woodlawn Golf Club is one of the area's most affordable and there's also a college and high school discount.",https://www.woodlawngolfmi.com/,,,,,,

The newer back is a bit more difficult, highlighted by the signature 13th, which plays 538-yards and crosses the San Gabriel twice.Getting there : From I-35 north, take the Lake Georgetown/Andice exit and turn left.

It is conveniently accessible from Harbor Beach/Caseville but also from metro Detroit and Flint. The course opened in 1924, making it one of the oldest in the area. As implied by the name, the golf course is characterized by the rolling topography, which stands out from the surrounding terrain that is predominantly flat. The layout features rolling fairways lined with trees and terraced greens framed by strategically placed bunkers. The golf course has a traditional design that is challenging but fair. It has some tricky holes that will appeal to more advanced players but it's forgiving enough to appeal to high handicappers. In addition to the golf course, Verona Hills also offers a large driving range as well as putting and chipping greens.",https://www.veronahillsgolf.com/,,,,,,

In addition to the river, another creek winds through the layout, keeping water in play on just about every hole.No. 6 is considered the signature not only for the stunning view of the countryside, but for its 185-yard poke over the water. The ender is tough as well, featuring trees along the left, the river on the right, and that pesky creek that fronts the green.Other notes: A tenth hole was added after the river temporarily swallowed No. 8. Walking is only allowed during the week.Getting there : From Hwy. 35, turn left on Latuelley, and the course is about a mile away.",https://www.facebook.com/baycity.countryclub.3,,,,,,
15148,Bay Valley Hotel & Resort,"Bay Valley Resort & Conference Center is situated in the heart of the Great Lakes Region of Bay City. Desmond Muirhead designed the golf course in 1973. The traditional layout is characterized by its very large, fast greens. Water is a prominent feature on the course, coming into play on 13 holes. The golf course is also well bunkered, but there are only rare occasions where you'll have to carry a bunker in order to reach the green, and it is quite forgiving even if your shots are short. The terrain is mostly flat, making it a pleasant golf course to walk. It's not the most formidable test, but it's an excellent option for advanced players looking for a casual round or beginners who want some practice. Bay Valley's playability makes it ideal for tournaments and group outings as well.",https://bayvalley.com/,,,,,,

Nicklaus fully utilized the natural features of the land, incorporating the subtle movement of the terrain, the wetlands, and the abundant mature oaks and pines. The blooming magnolias add a colorful accent to the already lush landscape. The course has a versatile mix of holes ranging from tight and short to long and open.

The golf course is not as seemingly easy as one would think since the open landscape is also subject to strong winds. There are also stands of mature trees throughout as well as waste areas that are waiting to swallow up errant shots. It is not a formidable test by any means but it is not a simple pitch-and-putt either. Players of all skill levels can get some good practice in at Riegelwood Country Club.",,,,,,,

He also incorporated subtle mounding and strategically placed bunkers that blend seamlessly into the natural terrain. Panks created a fair challenge with this layout but the wide, player-friendly landing areas makes the golf course approachable for beginners. The second hole is one of the most scenic holes on the course but it is also one of the layout's more difficult holes.

The neat fairways and tricky greens will challenge golfers of all levels, while there are plenty of risk-reward opportunities for daring players.

The courses share many characteristics including challenging greens, playable fairways, and over 100 bunkers strategically placed throughout each course. As its name would suggest, the Palms Course plays through stands of swaying palm trees. The scenic landscape is meticulously maintained, which allows the greens to putt fast and true. The Palms has less water than the Lakes Course but water is still a prominent presence, especially on the front nine where it comes into play on every hole. The challenge on the back nine comes from the numerous bunkers situated along the fairways. At 6,567 yards the Palms Course is just a hair shorter than the Lakes Course but they are equally challenging.",https://menifeelakesgolf.com/,,,,,,
15542,Monarch Beach Golf Links,"Playing at Monarch Beach Golf Links will bring to mind the great traditions of Scottish links golf.

The course offers small, rolling greens and tight fairways that are both kept in excellent condition. Strategically placed bunkers wait treacherously throughout the course and there are a number of tricky doglegs to watch out for.

The legendary architect made his home off the par-5 sixth hole and regarded the difficult, uphill 16th as one of the best par 4s ever designed by him or anyone else. To make it even better, the golf club embarked on a two-year restoration project headed up by Tom Doak. The result was nothing less than spectacular as bunkers and greens were to returned original specifications with modern turf and drainage technology. With its great design and elevation changes, Pasatiempo Golf Club plays much longer than its yardage and will test good players. The back nine is particularly strong, perhaps as good as any in the country.",https://www.pasatiempo.com/,,,,,,
