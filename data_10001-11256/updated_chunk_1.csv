The small greens have challenging slopes ranging from subtle breaks to dramatic drop-offs. To make them even tougher, you'll find strategically placed bunkers lurking along the edges. The tricky doglegs, which are mostly par 4s, will force you to think carefully about your club selection, and to top it all off, water makes an appearance on almost every hole.

The course offers small, rolling greens and tight fairways that are both kept in excellent condition.

This monster doglegs left inside a cliff that runs along the right side. Out-of-bounds is left, and a fairway bunker resides about a lob wedge from the narrow green, which is bolstered from behind by more bunkers.No. 18 is one of the more interesting finishing holes that you’ll come across, featuring two dogleg fairways, one right and one left, that both involve dealing with the creek that splits the two routes. The tee shot right is more favorable, since it is void of fairway bunkers like the ones on the left side. However, this option involves carrying two bunkers and the creek on the approach.Getting there : From I-20 west, take the Bryant/Irvin Rd. exit and turn left. Drive 2.5 miles to the course.

The fairways are tight and lined with trees, demanding a fair amount of accuracy. The greens also play fairly quick. The golf course does provide a challenging round but it is seemingly much tougher than it actually is. Beginners should still feel comfortable taking on the course.

Although there is an abundance of trees, the course still has many wide-open areas. The pristine white sand bunkers and colorful wildflowers are a beautiful contrast to the lush green of the course. The layout is not particularly long, but golfers should be prepared for a challenging round of target golf.

The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times.

The 583-yard No. 3 bends left around a lake and plays to a tricky little green nestled against water's edge.On the back, you'll remember the ender-an almost 600-yard tree-lined monster.

10366,Ojai Valley Inn & Spa,"Opened in 1923, Ojai Valley Inn Golf Course is one of California's first great courses. Over the decades that the course has been open, it has hosted a number of professional players and celebrities ranging from Arnold Palmer to Will Smith. George C. Thomas, Jr., who created the Riviera, collaborated with Billy Bell to design the original golf course but Jay Morrish made the layout considerably more challenging with renovations in 1988. Ten years later, two holes from the original Thomas/Bell layout that were lost during a redesign following WWII were completely restored and incorporated into the layout. The challenging golf course is very narrow in some spots and it features undulating greens that putt fast and true. The layout is not particularly long but it requires accuracy and proper club selection in order to score well.",https://www.ojaivalleyinn.com/,,,,,,

Starting from one of golf’s most iconic first-tee perches, the golfer descends, climbs and winds through valleys, over barrancas that come into play on several holes and finally uphill to the amphitheater 18th green.Riviera is home to one of the game’s most recognizable par 3s and one of its great short par 4s. The former is the short 6th hole, with a pot bunker in the middle of the sweeping, multi-tiered green. The latter: the 10th, whose broad fairway and strategic bunkering gives way to one of the toughest-to-hit putting surfaces in the world. Even the best golfers in the world routinely make scores from 2 to 8 there.In addition to the PGA Tour’s annual Genesis Invitational, Riviera has a considerable major championship pedigree, including a U.S. Open (1948) and two PGA Championships (1983, 1995).",https://www.therivieracountryclub.com/,,,,,,

And escape is anything but guaranteed. Sometimes getting out of one bunker, just means landing in another at Desert Falls.That is just part of the reason this course totes a 145 slope rating - putting it among the five highest slope ratings in the entire Palms Springs area. Remember, this is the golf mecca with Pete Dye's Stadium Course, which was only designed to be ""the toughest golf course in the world."" Desert Falls is on that list.There are five sets of tees to take away some of the bite. But the greens are still an obstacle of their own. These are undulating greens that are large enough to offer several varieties of challenges.Just getting on the green is not enough at Desert Falls.
