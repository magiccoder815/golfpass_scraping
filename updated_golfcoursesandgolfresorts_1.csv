39,Avila Beach Resort,"Avila Beach Golf Resort is located right along the bay, giving it a scenic setting that has made it the most well known of the Central Coast golf courses. The layout offers plenty of variety with a hilly front nine that features small, often elevated, greens that are surrounded by oak-lined valleys and a back nine that that is routed across a tidal estuary. Golfers should be prepared for forced carries over water and multi-tiered greens on the backside. At first the course may seem short, but thanks to the dramatic elevation changes and numerous other challenges, it will begin to feel much longer. There are several severe doglegs throughout as well as tight approaches. Avila Beach Golf Resort is not a layout where you can easily ""grip it and rip it.""

The fairways are relatively wide and some are lined with trees and the fairly large greens are sloped and fast.

The country club sits just 10 minutes outside of downtown Cincinnati.A Scottish golfer and designer, Bendelow created several Midwest courses. Bendelow designed 800-plus North American courses, working with land he was assigned: In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, architects didn't get their turf, rocks and water features trucked in. Born Sept. 2, 1868, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bendelow began golfing when he was 9 years old, with his dad at the Balgownie Links, which now goes by Royal Aberdeen Golf Club - founded in 1780, Royal Aberdeen Golf Club is the world's sixth-oldest, and it's clear that Bendelow had rich inspiration to draw on back in Scotland.After a round of golf at the Western Hills Country Club, head back to the Grill Porch for nibbles and sips.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10555,,,,,,

Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3302,,,,,,

The course has a traditional design that is player-friendly enough to appeal to beginners while also offering a few challenges. There are numerous bunkers strategically placed throughout and water hazards also come into play on a few holes. It is not the most formidable test but more advanced players will still have fun, especially if they are just looking for a quick round.

445,Soldiers Creek Golf Club At The Preserve,"The course at Soldiers Creek Golf Club was designed by Scott Clark, a former Golf Course Superintendent at The Grand Hotel in Point Clear Alabama and the current Superintendent at The Peninsula Golf Club in Gulf Shores Alabama. While this is Scott's first attempt in playing the role of a course architect, it also reveals his depth of experience in the golf course industry. The design goals of building a course that would be enjoyable for high handicappers as well as low handicappers was met in this design.The course features wide player-friendly fairways. Also, water comes into play on only two holes which makes navigating this course easier for high handicappers. A large natural turf driving range and 10,000 square foot practice green is available as a warm-up or practice area.Soldiers Creek Golf Club is owned by the Norman Woerner family. Norman is a member of the Woerner Turf family of sod producers. Woerner Turf is a world-wide leader in turf production. The company provides turf for many golf courses ranging from Augusta National to new courses in Hong Kong. They also supply the turf for the NFL Super Bowl and the NFL Pro Bowl in Hawaii.Southern Turf Nurseries provided the Tif Eagle for Soldiers Creek Golf Club. This turf grass is considered by many to be the best-of-the-best turf for southern golf course greens. The fairways and roughs are Tif 419, a dense-growing emerald-colored grass that's perfect for plush fairways.The greens feature Tif Eagle, the newest and best-of-the-best southern turf grass for golf course greens. An increasingly popular choice for new golf courses and redesigns, this turf permits a closer cut, thus allowing for smoother, faster greens.Located only several miles from Alabama's sun-kissed Gulf Coast, this new 18 hole championship course is part of the Woerner Preserve Resort. Our friendly staff welcomes you to play the newest course on the Gulf Coast. Yes, we are now open. Come spend some time with family or friends. Relax and enjoy a round of golf in this natural setting.DIRECTIONS: From I-10, take exit 44 (Gulf Shores Pkwy/Hwy 59 South). Travel south on Hwy 59 for approx. 18 miles.

The championship layout features a variety of challenges including tree-lined fairways, water hazards, and strategically placed sand traps. There are also a few sharp doglegs to watch out for. It's the many elevation changes though, which can range from subtle to dramatic, that are the true test of this golf course. Be prepared for several tricky uphill, downhill, and sidehill lies.

The mission was to embrace the beauty of the natural environment and preserve the natural resources offered by the wetlands and forests. Playing either golf course you’ll be surrounded by pristine landscapes abundantly filled with native wildlife. The Mountain View Course is the longer and more challenging of the two. While it may not have as much water as the aptly named Lake View, the Mountain View golf course will truly test your shot-making abilities with narrow fairways tightly lined with trees and several tricky doglegs.

Wind definitely plays a role on the front nine and on the backside of the course there is a 26-acre, man-made lake, where if you're not careful you'll be met with a watery grave on five holes. Extensive mounding is paired with 30 strategically placed sand traps to provide even more challenges. The most difficult hole on the golf course is the par-4 16th, which stretches to more than 400 yards.

840,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

It's easy to get distracted on this visually stunning golf course, but it's a test that requires all of your attention. The first hole is challenging but gentler than the next three holes, which is one of the toughest sequences in the area. The second and thrid are long uphill par 4s and the fourth is a narrow par 5 with a marsh-protected green. Moose Ridge Golf Club's back nine opens more gently but the respite doesn't last for long.

The holes on the backside are more heavily treed and demand greater accuracy. Strategically placed bunkers frame the greens, making the approaches even more intimidating, and the river also comes into play.

Although they share the same scenic landscape, the courses have a unique character as well as a different set of challenges. Betsie Valley's tight layout and small greens make it a true shot-maker's course. Many of the greens are also severely sloped, making them even more challenging. One of the toughest holes is the par-5 10th, which doglegs right and plays longer than the scorecard indicates.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/902,,,,,,

The club was established in 1929, making it one of the state's older courses. The player-friendly layout has a traditional design that is on the shorter side, measuring to just over 5,900 yards from the back tees. The holes are fairly straightforward and there are no hidden hazards. The golf course does require a fair amount of accuracy though with mature trees lining the fairways. There are also strategically placed sand bunkers guarding most of the greens. It might not what you are looking for if you are searching for a formidable test, but it is great for a casual round.

You'll have to contend with 80 strategically placed sand bunkers and 17 different water hazards. While the course is not overly punishing, you'll have to be prepared to have every aspect of your game tested.

This challenging design is known for its undulating greens that will test even the most seasoned players. Each hole has a unique design that combines strategically placed bunkers, including large waste bunkers, and sloping grass swales. There is also carefully sculpted mounding along the edges of the fairways. On top of that, water comes into play on nearly every hole.

Creeks freely meander throughout the golf course, interconnecting with the sparkling ponds that can be found throughout. The layout is an Arnold Palmer design that takes advantage of the hills, bluffs, and hollows of the varied landscape. You face uneven lies and a few blind shots thanks to the terrain but you'll also get scenic views of the surrounding area. Accuracy is important to have but it's not an overly punishing layout if you happen to be errant. The golf course has a challenging start with an uphill par 3 as the opening hole. Another memorable hole is the par-3 eighth, which features a 50-foot drop to the fairway below. It's both an intimidating and beautiful hole.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15614,,,,,,

Lee Schmidt, who worked closely with Pete Dye, designed the golf course, and incorporated many of Dye's signature features into the design. Sculpted mounding and native grasses frame the generous landing areas and you'll even find Dye's trademark railroad ties framing the greens. There are also several lakes that come into play throughout. Oak Harbor Golf Club's seventh and 15th holes are particularly notable for their intimidating tee shots over water.

A renovation of the golf course resulted in a redesign of five holes on the front nine and a new irrigation system.

The club stayed put for half a century, noted for the presence of Harvey Penick. Then after a huge local debate, the facility was moved to Riverside Drive in East Austin. From there it made it another 35 years before moving to its current Davenport Ranch location.The current ACC layout, designed by Pete Dye, rests on the shores of Lake Austin and the Colorado River. Dye didn’t veer from his usual method of creating an impressively difficult track using his trademark railroad ties, deep pot bunkers, and huge undulations.The opening holes play along Lake Austin, and are more of a links-style design. Afterwards the Hill Country takes effect, featuring canyons, ravines, creeks, and unbelievable views.The back nine features many outstanding holes, including the 446-yard No. 11, which deceptively doglegs left along a canyon before requiring an approach over that same deep ravine. The par 3 No. 16 also stands out, featuring a long carry over another canyon.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2747,,,,,,

Then water becomes the predominant hazard on the back, impacting almost every hole. Your approaches will find fast, undulating bent-grass greens.The design features two challenging par 5s: The 549-yard No. 5 plays uphill into the prevailing wind, and No. 12 plays almost 600 yards with a tee shot through a chute of trees, and two more shots over water, including the approach into a green that is surrounded by the wet stuff. Another tough hole is No. 14, a 225-yard par 3 that requires a solid shot to carry the water.Getting there : From I-27 south, exit Hunsley and go west.

In 2002, Tom Lehman and John Fought redesigned the course, bringing tree-lined fairways and water into play on five holes. The course provides a reprieve from more-deserty desert courses in this desert. Phoenix Country Club was the first home of the Phoenix Open, through 1986.More recently, the Phoenix Country Club has hosted qualifiers for the U.S. Open (2003 and 2005), U.S. Women's Amateur (2003), and U.S. Women's Open (2004).",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14752,,,,,,

He also incorporated subtle mounding and strategically placed bunkers that blend seamlessly into the natural terrain. Panks created a fair challenge with this layout but the wide, player-friendly landing areas makes the golf course approachable for beginners. The second hole is one of the most scenic holes on the course but it is also one of the layout's more difficult holes.

Tiger actually won the Las Vegas Invitational (then a 90-hole, multi-course event) with a final round 64 on the private TPC at Summerlin track, erasing David Love III's four-stroke lead.Average hackers will find a course with plenty of trees in the desert and five inventive par 3s that give National much of its character. This isn't desert golf. It's old school golf with palm trees and sand.It is also very close to the Strip, just a few turns and about a 10-minute drive away. The area's built up around it with fast-food shops, but the Rat Pack era style remains alive within Las Vegas National's grounds.""As you pull into the lot at Las Vegas National, the sense of the sixties is evident in the rectangular pastel colored stucco clubhouse that might have seemed modernistic back then, but now is a charming reminder of an architecturally dated style,"" TravelGolf.com writer Doug Saunders said.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15937,,,,,,

One of these is the stunning 16th hole with its panoramic view of Sheep Mountain.

The 17th has a tough green fiercely guarded by out-of-bounds and the course saved the most difficult hole for last. This par 3 will test even the most seasoned golfers.

2462,Oak Valley Golf Club,"This course used to be considered a hidden gem. Now, Oak Valley Golf Course in Beaumont is an off-the-beaten-path known reasonable joy. Stopping on the way from Los Angeles to Palm Springs for a golf detour is no fool's play. Not with the fast greens, dramatic elevation changes and swerving fairways available at Oak Valley in Beaumont.A Lee Schmidt and Brian Curley design, Oak Valley is probably best known for greens that are anything but desert typical. Speed is the name of the game here, with a tap sometimes too much on a downhill putt.Recognition does not travel that quickly. It took a decade for Oak Valley to get a four star rating from Golf Digest. Once it did, Beaumont suddenly became a golf stopping spot on the Palm Springs express. Now, you're considered a smart golfer if you linger on the way to Palm Springs.""It's a nice getaway from the crowds in the desert, as well as some of the other, more populated golf areas,"" head pro Scott Arnold said. ""It's almost like being in the country. No houses line the fairways. Each hole is different. And because of the way it's laid out, you often can't even see another hole from the one you're playing.""",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14521,,,,,,

2660,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

The fairways are generous and forgiving though. The course is a fair test but it is especially tough on windy days. The interior, tree-lined holes contrast nicely with the waterfront holes and they have the added benefit of protection from the prevailing sea breezes. North Shore Country Club is a player-friendly layout that both beginners and seasoned players can enjoy, which is why it has become one of the Outer Banks' most popular golfing destinations.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10239,,,,,,

The natural wetlands and vegetation were carefully preserved, earning all four courses certification as Audubon Cooperative Sanctuaries. The Players Club was designed by North Carolina native Tim Cate. It stands out from the other courses thanks to its stunning views of the rolling Carolina countryside. The challenging layout is quite memorable too with narrow fairways that demand accuracy and numerous waste bunkers strategically placed throughout. There is also a smattering of coastal Carolina hardwoods that can be tricky to maneuver.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10247,,,,,,

The nine-hole layout is gentle enough for beginners but it is great for a fun, quick round regardless of skill level. The course is an enjoyable walk with houses providing a backdrop to the lush fairways and manicured greens. Water hazards come into play on a few holes and there are also a few strategically placed bunkers lurking beside the greens.

His work earned the golf course designation as an Audubon Sanctuary. The nines: Ibis, Egret, and Heron; all have different challenges. However, they all have challenging greens that boast some of the best conditions in the area. The Ibis is the most player-friendly of the nines. Carolina National Golf Club's 27-hole layout is played as three different 18-hole combinations.

The back nine is a scenic round of holes, sprawling across gently rolling hills studded with mature trees. There are also some challenging par 3s that require a carry over water.

It's one of western New York's most accessible public golf courses. The course opened in 1930 as the first public nine-hole layout in LeRoy. The creation of the golf course was spearheaded by Orator Woodward, youngest song of Jell-O magnate Donald Woodward. He believed the landscape of rolling hills and meandering streams was the ideal setting for a round of golf. The natural contours of the terrain helped to determine the placement of the bunkers. Water comes into play on a few holes at LeRoy Country Club, most notably on the finishing two. A large lake on the 17th turns into a creek that wanders across the middle of the final par-3 hole.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/9483,,,,,,

The course has a classic parkland layout that plays across gently rolling hills. The fairways were cut through forests of mature hardwoods but they are wide and carefully sculpted to direct balls toward the middle. Skillful players could even try to use the contours to their advantage. Each hole has a bunkers but the bunkering is not excessive. In addition to the mounding and bunkering, the undulating terrain provides natural elevation changes. The golf course finishes with what is arguably its toughest hole. This monster par 5 is 620 yards from the back tees. It requires a drive over a ravine with a natural waste area to the left. Many consider it to be the toughest golf hole in northern Virginia.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/16248,,,,,,

Although it is more than 500 yards shorter, it still offers plenty of challenges. There are water hazards that come into play as well as several strategically placed bunkers. One of the trickiest holes is the par-3 third, which requires a carry over a massive lake to a small green. Although there are also mature trees lining the fairways, the holes are fairly straightforward. Beginners can approach this golf course with confidence but more advanced players will find it to be a fun casual round. The Gold Course is a better option for a tougher challenge. Cedarbrook also has a full practice range and several putting and chipping greens.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/11451,,,,,,

Formerly a stable, the course features large meadows and dense groves of trees that frame the fairways and greens. The layout has a more traditional, links design that features occasional water hazards, most notably on the par-5 ninth and 18th holes that share a large lake, but the tree-covered hills are the true challenge of the golf course. Although there are many difficult elements on this course, five sets of tees make it accessible for players of all skill levels.

The golf course incorporates a variety of elevation changes that range from subtle to dramatic. With narrow, tree-lined fairways and undulating greens, accuracy will serve you well on this course. You'll face several doglegs and there are strategically placed bunkers fiercely guarding the greens. Broadacres Golf Club's signature third hole is one of the toughest holes in the area.

3419,Great Rock Golf Club,"Opened in 2001, Great Rock Golf Club is one of the newer golf clubs in Long Island but it feels much older thanks to its scenic landscape of rolling green hills covered with mature forests. The mountainous landscape provides plenty of elevation changes that make it difficult to find a flat lie. At 6,254 yards, the course is short but it is still a challenging round with narrow, tree-lined fairways that demand accuracy. There is hardly any water on the golf course but with strategically placed bunkers, sidehill lies, and towering trees to contend with, golfers will hardly notice the absence of water hazards. Great Rock's signature hole is the challenging 10th. This par-4 beast is a double uphill climb with a seemingly flat green, but if you read it that way, you're in for some trouble.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/20370,,,,,,

3513,Hillcrest Golf Club,"Alvin's second country club opened in the 1960s, built by a man named Shorty Plaster who wanted to make the most of his land investment. Shorty was a hacker and his short course is designed to accommodate the lesser golfer with its executive-like 2,385-yard length.Plaster's design opens up with three par 3s, followed by another on No. 5. Every par 4 plays 350 yards or less, and the sole par 5 is only 475 yards. Not many non-par-3 9-holers are blessed with lights, but this one is. The same goes for the driving range, so you can definitely spend some hours at this nice little country course.Getting there : From I-45 south, exit Dixie Farm Rd. and turn right. Drive 8 miles to where it dead-ends, then turn on Hwy 35. Drive 8 miles to Fairway Dr. and turn left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2726,,,,,,

There is an interesting mix of holes ranging from reachable par 5s to short, tough par 3s and each hole has a distinct character. The greens are fast and the gently rolling terrain provides some subtle breaks that can be tricky. Bunkering is sparsely but strategically placed along the fairways and greensides. There are also a few water hazards that come into play at Apollo Elks Country Club.

None of the holes run parallel to each other and no two holes are alike either. The greens have quite a bit of variation from one to the next but mostly they are very large and extremely fast. Although the greens only have mild contouring, the rippling landscape still provides plenty of challenges throughout. Strategically placed bunkers perfectly complement the dramatic elevation changes, ranging from pot bunkers to vast expanses of sand. Inniscrone Golf Club's ninth hole is a memorable one since it encapsulates the course's appeal with a ridge of cross-bunkers just off the tee and even more along the left side.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1370,,,,,,

A small pond also comes into play on two holes. The challenging fairways are tight and lined with mature trees including towering firs, cottonwoods, and maple trees. The small, heavily bunkered greens make the course even trickier. Meadowlands Golf & Country Club's signature hole is the par-4 14th.

The golf course is playable but that doesn't mean golfers won't come across a fair amount of challenges. The 13th and 18th are two particularly tricky holes.

The spacious golf course has several holes that will please long hitters, but this layout will test your accuracy and course-management skills too. Water comes into play most memorably on Greencastle's signature third hole where there is a man-made waterfall and fountain but the par-4 10th is the toughest.

4167,Colonial Country Club,"Colonial Country Club, located in Fort Worth on the southern banks of the Trinity River and near TCU, is one of the most historic golf clubs in Texas. The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times. Other multiple winners of this longstanding PGA Tour event include Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Nick Price and Ben Crenshaw.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/21496,,,,,,

Well known golf course designer George Fazio created a nice mix of holes about 45 minutes northwest of Philadelphia. The golf course isn't overly long and doesn't feature a lot of trouble, but it's long on fun. The signature par-4 third, a dogleg right around woods, is a pretty hole and worth the trip.

There are many challenges throughout the golf course including deep rough, expansive wetlands, eight ponds, and sloped greens that are often tiered.

An abundance of trees characterizes the course, giving all of the holes a secluded feel that is further enhanced by the design, which doesn't feature any parallel fairways.

Mounded bunkers and moguls define the movement of the fairways and though there aren't many trees, if you don't keep your shots straight you might find yourself out-of-bounds or lost in the high, wiry grass. Sidehill lies await you as well as a few blind shots. Wyncote's greens have little undulation but the lightning fast putting surfaces are a challenge for players of all skill levels.

The golf course is known for its playability but there are several challenges in store that will test your shot-making skills. The course starts out mildly with a front nine that sprawls across gently undulating meadows while the back nine gets hillier and more challenging. There are more lakes and strategically placed bunkers that come into play on the back as well as a hidden brook that is just waiting for errant shots. Regent's Glen's 11th hole is one of the most intimidating, with a large lake along the fairway. If you dare to carry a portion of this hazard, you'll be rewarded with a shorter approach to the flagstick, however the hidden brook and deep bunker in front of the green will make that very difficult.

The layout is definitely indicative of his style and it is considered one of southern Ohio's ""must-play"" courses. The layout has demanding approach shots balanced by generous landing areas, one of Nicklaus' trademark features. His unwavering dedication to preserving the natural landscapes he works with is also apparent in the unspoiled beauty of the terrain. Hundreds of mature trees cover the golf course, which extends beyond 7,000 yards from the tips. The fairways twist around a series of lakes and streams and the subtly contoured greens can also be tricky.

Drawing more from the style of classic American courses, the back nine has a dramatic rolling landscape blanketed with trees, which often come into play along the fairways.

The course was built in 2001, though you would not be able to tell from its traditional links design. It manages to be a classic links golf course while still being a challenge. The site was originally a horse farm and the design incorporates some of the features from the terrain's former use. Water hazards come into play frequently throughout the golf course and there are trees and rough lining the fairways. Golfers will find many risk-reward opportunities on the course, one good example being the par-4 eighth. This hole plays into the prevailing wind and if you miss your drive, you may find yourself in one of the eight bunkers surrounding the undulating green.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/21396,,,,,,

Water hazards come into play on four holes, most notably on the scenic par-3 second, which requires an accurate downhill tee shot to a green that is over surrounded by both water and trees.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/11001,,,,,,

To complement the natural beauty of the land, the course is constantly kept in superb condition. There are also lakes that come into play as well as several sand traps. The course starts with three of its signature holes. The first hole features a tree-lined fairway and requires a shot to a plateaued green with the creek running along the back. The third hole is arguably the most difficult tee shot at Rattlesnake Ridge, with the creek treacherously awaiting any errant shots that go to the left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14917,,,,,,

Designed by the ever artful hand of Tom Fazio, the golf course is built over terrain, which was coaxed from the marshes by a series of dikes, intended to create more land for cotton fields during the great plantation days of Dataw Island.The 18 holes of Cotton Dike require strategy and accuracy and, in return, provide a tireless golfing experience with a variety of interesting challenges. Almost half of the 18 holes lie along the marsh and Jenkins Creek, a wonderful contrast of the natural beauty of the low country and the precision design of the Cotton Dike course.Cotton Dike, which opened in 1985, is 6,787 yards from the longest tees for a par of 72.

Both courses are known for their exceptional greens that offer fast, smooth putting surfaces. The course wanders through the forests of majestic pines and native vegetation that border Lake Marion. The fairways are lined with trees and form twisting doglegs that can be quite tricky to navigate. The layout consists of an interesting mix of holes including challenging par 3s and risk-reward par 5s, which are all spread across a variety of different elevation changes. It is a golf course that will test your skills with different shot requirements, so be prepared to use every club in your bag.

There are also five sparkling lakes throughout that come into play on several holes. The front nine is wide open but the course narrows as you move onto the back nine and it also becomes more wooded.

The golf course is just under 6,500 yards from the back tees, offering a good mix of length with some shorter holes. With water hazards coming into play on several holes as well as a good number of strategically placed bunkers, it is a course that will make you think.

Sprawling across a lush landscape blanketed with century-old oaks and towering pines, the layout is as scenic as it is challenging. While the generous fairways may be player friendly, the difficult approaches to the elevated, well bunkered greens are anything but. The large, pristine white sand bunkers were designed in true Palmer-style, closely following the natural undulations of the land. The gently rolling terrain is unique for the area.

The back nine presents a totally different look. The first six holes meander through what used to be quail-hunting pastures. The last three border the marsh and present magnificent views of the Chechessee River, with the Broad River, Parris Island and Port Royal off on the horizon.Thoughtfully shaped to respect its natural surroundings, the golf course is distinguished not only by its playability but also by for its respect to its natural surroundings. Neither a home nor another fairway can be seen from many of the holes. Old Tabby Links measures 7,135 yards from the longest tees for a par of 72.The 17th hole, a beautiful and treacherous waterside par-3, is the course's signature hole.

It has a challenging but playable design that will appeal to players of all skill levels. Four different sets of tees make it even more accommodating. Water is a prominent feature of the course but there are strategically placed sand traps to contend with as well. The narrow fairways also demand accuracy. Water comes into play most notably on the signature 13th hole. This tricky par 3 has an island green that forces golfers to think creatively.

5632,Riverchase Golf Club,"One of Jim Fazio’s first solo projects, Riverchase is a surprisingly tough challenge given its lack of trees and relatively short length. The course runs through the bottomlands of the Elm Fork Trinity River and is loaded with water due to a chain of interconnecting lakes created to collect heavy rains and irrigate the course. While there are no forced carries, water comes into play at least 12 holes, and out-of-bounds is a frequent concern because of the housing community that surrounds the course.No. 5 is the most difficult rated hole–a long dogleg right par 4 that requires a solid tee shot to be in position to reach the green in two. The approach is long and uphill into a severely back-to-front sloping green with a lake on the right and out-of-bounds and bunkers on the left.Two holes later, No. 7 is one of the toughest approaches in all of DFW. This hole plays due south into the prevailing wind, and the elevated green has a depth of only about 25 feet. Bunkers line the back, and the slope in front is significant. Ups and downs are difficult because of the slopes in the green. Take a look at the pin placement when you’re teeing off on No. 4.The good news is that other than out-of-bounds, the course is mostly wide open, so you’ll generally have a shot if you just miss the fairway. The only thick spot for trees is along the creek on holes 14-16.Getting there : Take the Belt Line exit off of 635 and drive north to MacArthur. Turn right (east) and drive to Riverchase Dr., where you’ll turn left. Look for the course on the right side of the road.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14579,,,,,,

5662,Thorntree Country Club,"Thorntree opened in 1984, and while it has changed ownership multiple times over the years,it remains one of the toughest courses in the DFW area. The course features six lakes and three spring-fed creeks that spice up the layout, as well as immaculate fairways and challenging bent-grass greens.On the front, No. 5 stands out as one of the most difficult holes – a 400 yard-plus par 4 that runs through a chute of trees and doglegs right into a green sided by a pond.The back is a bit more difficult, which you’ll realize quickly due to the 666-yard double dogleg No. 10. The next hole is only a 382- yard par 4, but the approach is dicey into the shallow green. No. 13 is another nice hole–only 338 yards with another challenging approach into a green that’s guarded by an old thorn tree.Getting there : From I-35 south, take the Wintergreen Road exit and turn right.

5666,Yoakum County Golf Club,"Located between Denver City and Plains, Yoakum County is a wide-open course that was built on moderately rolling terrain. Water hazards (ponds, lakes, creeks, and streams) come into play on over half the holes, which is surprising for a course in this region. Avoid the driver if you can, as the course is short enough to score well without it. (You might need the driver, though, on the number-one handicap, a 440-yard, par 4 No. 14.)Watch for storms blowing in quickly on hot, summer afternoons. The course gained a few moments of fame one recent June when newscasts captured winds upwards of 100 MPH that took out whole trees and blew roofs off buildings.Getting there : From Lubbock drive through Brownfield; 12 miles south is Wellman.

5667,Underwood Golf Complex(Sunrise Course at Underwood Golf Complex ),"Sunrise opened in April of 1995, bringing a more modern layout to the Underwood facility. Ken Dye (Painted Dunes) built the course as sort of a Scottish links/desert-style track with undulating fairways and a multitude of water hazards. Quite a bit of dirt was moved to sculpt the flat terrain.On the front No. 5 stands out because it plays as a 465-yard par 4, but No. 9 is the most difficult because of its even greater length-a 587-yard par 5. Holes of note on the back are the 302-yard No. 11, which offers a great chance for birdie; another long par 4 in No. 13 (452 yards); and the mean 18th, a 441-yard dogleg right.Getting there : Located off I-10 and Gateway. From I-10 east, take US Hwy. 54 north and exit Ellerthorpe.

This is a fairly long, desert-style course that winds through a residential subdivision with out-of-bounds lining narrow fairways on many holes. Some holes have slight elevation changes and can leave you with uneven lies.Hole 4 offers a nice touch: a 384-yard par 4 with an outstanding view of El Paso and Mexico. The long No. 17 has out-of-bounds on either side of the fairway, and a water hazard 100 yards out from the green. At 450 yards even a big drive leaves you with a long approach. The 13th hole is only 307 yards and doglegs right, which tempts you to cut the corner over the apartments.Getting there : Take the Lee Trevino exit off of I-10.

The course has a classic design that is player friendly enough for beginners and even gentle enough juniors. It may not be what you're looking for if you want a formidable test, but more advanced players will appreciate it for a quick casual round. It's also great for working on your short game skills. The golf course is short and tight with immaculately manicured greens.

5677,Stonebriar Country Club,"Located at what for now is the end of the north-bound Dallas Tollway is the Stonebriar's Fazio Course, 30 minutes from downtown Dallas and an ideal business or resort getaway because of its convenient location near the generally fast moving north-south thoroughfare. And in addition to the hotel-business conference amenities, there’s the spectacular Tom Fazio route awaiting that is open for play only to resort guests and members of the adjoining Stonebriar Country Club.This place embodies Dallas’ northward surge. In the 1960s and 1970s, the new construction was further south in Richardson and Plano, when places like Preston Trails defined the suburbs’ northern edge. However, these days the edge is up this way in Frisco. On this once-barren, extremely flat farmland that served primarily as a hayfield lies the still reasonably flat Fazio track (although he moved over 600,000 yards of earth during construction) that is famous for its lightning-fast, Augusta-like putting surfaces. Made up of the new heat-resistant A-4 bentgrass that was installed recently at Fort Worth’s Colonial Country Club, these babies are certain three-jacks if you fail to pay attention to the pin placements with your approach.The greens are the signature at the Stonebriar, since Fazio’s layout is surprisingly hacker-friendly, mostly void of forced carries with fairways framed by mounds that seem to push the ball back into the fairway. The mounding also has a pleasing aesthetic purpose, making it impossible to see the neighboring fairways and greens.The best hole on the front is No. 2, a 407-yard doglegger that tees uphill over a wetland and involves an approach over a creek into a bunker-guarded green.On the back Fazio dropped in a 5-acre lake that comes into play on Nos. 11 and 14, both 400-yard-plus par 4s. Bunkers line the fairway on No. 11, and the hole doglegs right against the wind. Besides the lake on No. 14, the deep, multi-level green is the problem most likely to drive your score up.Getting there : From Hwy. 121 north, take the Legacy Ave. exit and west. The clubhouse is on the left side of the street.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/22706,,,,,,
5678,"Trails of Frisco Golf Club, The","The Trails of Frisco golf course is one of Jeff Brauer’s most unique designs -- primarily because it doesn’t fit the mold of his other courses. Brauer, who’s known for his open, straight-forward courses, designed this one to tip out to a par 71, 6,900 yards, loaded it with hidden creeks, scenic wetlands, extensive bunkering, and massive greens. In fact, first-timers will be confused here. They’ll face intimidating views off the tee that leave doubt as to the problems that loom ahead, and it is definitely possible to lose all of your balls off the tee if you’re struggling.The golf course is just flat-out challenging, especially on the front nine. No. 1 opens up with a creek on the left that cuts in front of the green and generally makes its presence known on every shot. The play here is to stay right and stay away from its subtle presence on the left side. The creek comes into play on Nos. 2, 4, 5, and even No. 9, where it chutes from the fairway in front of the green and surrounds the green of this challenging par 4.All told, water and waste areas are in play on 16 of 18 holes (including every par 3), and the creeks are enhanced by visible lakes and ponds on the back side, even though it is considered a bit easier than the front.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/22710,,,,,,
5679,Weston Lakes Country Club,"The tiny town of Fulshear offers an impressive, Carlton Gipson/Hale Irwin-designed golf course for its membership. Ancient pecans line the fairways, and an extensive system of lakes sets the landscape for this long, difficult course. Out-of-bounds lines many holes, and frequent windy conditions make it a challenging task to keep the ball in play.The front nine is highlighted by the mammoth 591-yard, par 5 8th hole, which starts the toughest stretch of golf around the turn. In fact, the top three most difficult rated holes encompass holes 8-10. No. 9 plays 412 yards into the clubhouse, followed by the unwelcome 453-yard par 4 No. 10 after your beer and hot dog at the turn.Getting there : From I-10 west, take the FM 359 exit and drive south.

5681,White Wing Golf Club,"White Wing Golf Club opened its first opened with nine holes in June of 2000, and followed shortly thereafter with the complete package. Often compared to the nearby 1996 Legacy Hills, White Wing isn't quite as long, but is definitely more narrow, lined with massive old oak trees, some of which are located right in the middle of the fairway. Many times even if you pure the tee shot down the middle, you'll be forced to hustle a punch shot under one of these majestic trees.Billy Casper's design is known for its challenging par 5s, one of which is the signature finishing hole. No. 18 plays downhill into a split fairway, offering a more aggressive shot to the right that must clear Berry Creek at 210 yards out, which gives you the chance to get home in two. If you play it left, you'll need three good shots to get to the green, one of which will involve dealing with one of the huge oaks that looms in the fairway.White Wing Golf Club's most difficult hole is the par-4 No. 4, which requires an accurate tee shot between fairway bunkers, followed by an approach over a bunker into a multi-level green",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/16413,,,,,,

Of the par 3 courses in the Valley, this is considered one of the best. The course lays out over flat terrain and several lakes come into play, making water hazards the most prominent cause of difficulty.The course wanders through the housing community with a few trees spread throughout the course. Six of the nine holes have water, which is dyed blue for aesthetics. The greens are large and elevated, and grass berms are incorporated into the design to add character.The most difficult hole is No. 9, mainly because it is the longest at 161 yards. Also, there's water to the right and behind the green, as well as a large tree beside the lake that catches errant shots. The best birdie opportunity is No. 8.Other notes: There is no formal pro shop. Guest fees are voluntary and there is a box to slip the payment in.Getting there : From McAllen, take Hwy 83 east to Hwy 77. Turn north and drive 3 miles to the course.

While not an overbearing factor, water hazards come into play throughout the design.Getting there : From Hwy 77 driving south, exit on Ed Carey and turn left. When you come to Business 77 turn right, drive down to Trailer Hills Blvd. and turn left.

5690,Tangle Oaks Golf Club,"Former Haskell Country Club superintendent Mark Bailey and his wife Gayle first broke ground for this course northeast of Hawley on New Year’s Day, 1996. Two and half years later, the original nine holes opened. Construction on the next nine wrapped up in 2002, leaving 18 outstanding holes for the public.Tangle Oaks is an appropriate name. The course is carved out of an extremely dense oak thicket, sometimes referred to as “the shinnery.” In fact, the shinnery is so thick that it’s played as a lateral hazard– players just drop from where the ball went into the briar-patch-like rough. Length is not imperative, but accuracy is key. The greens are elevated, tilt from back to front, and have a medium to high slope.The fairways are quite tight, due to the oaks. The strategy is simple. Keep it straight or you'll get in trouble. Length is not important, but accuracy is a must.The signature hole is No. 9, a 383-yard par 4 that plays into the teeth of the stiff west Texas wind. To further a golfer's sheer terror, the green is completely fronted by water and a formidable retaining wall. On the back the most notable hole is No. 13, which features an island green. Hole 18 is unique because of the split fairway.Other notes: The county is dry, but Tangle Oaks allows you to bring your own beer.

5691,Texaco Country Club,"Originally opened as a 9-holer in 1924 for the Texas Co., TCC is the oldest existing private course in Houston that is still in its current location. Another nine was added in 1938, creating the full golf experience with a design that incorporated the unusual Cypress Pond. The pond is loaded with lily pads and cypress trees, which complements this traditional track quite well. The greens are small and undulating-difficult targets but fairly reasonable two-putts.No. 11 is the toughest hole at 563 yards. Considered one of the best holes in the Houston area, it's a double dogleg that has lots of trees and Greens Bayou to boot.Getting there : From I-10 going east, get off at the Federal Rd. exit and make a left.

5697,Walden on Lake Houston Golf & Country Club,"Patterned after the successful Robert Von Hagge/Bruce Devlin-designed Walden on Lake Conroe, this course opened in 1982 and immediately became known for its numerous bunkers and lakes. Considered a shotmaker's course, this layout features over 100 bunkers and requires precise play throughout.Holes of note are the intimidating opening hole-a long, bending par 4 with a lake guarding the right side. Beware of the pin placement on this multi-tiered green. No. 8 is a 429-yard par 4 that requires a long drive and perfect approach because of the channel that guards the tiny, bunker-loaded green. On the back No. 14 is the best, dominated by a large lake in the fairway. At 444 yards it also requires a challengingly long approach into a small green.Getting there : From U.S. Hwy. 59 north, take the FM 1960 exit and go east for 8 miles to the course.

5714,Walden on Lake Conroe Golf & Country Club,"Long considered the best course in the Houston area, Walden rolls through a spectacular setting on the southwest shores of Lake Conroe and offers one of the most memorable golf experiences in Texas.The course was designed by Robert von Hagge and Bruce Devlin, who moved over 300,000 cubic yards of earth to extend the lakefront property. This famous spot is now home to the unforgettable 589-yard double dogleg, which rounds out the impressive stretch of par 5 holes that make up Nos. 9-11.More about No. 11: A draw is preferable off the tee, avoiding the trees and out-of-bounds that guard the left side. The key second shot should be a fairway wood left, avoiding Lake Conroe that comes into play on the right. If that shot is solid you'll face a 120-150 yard approach over the lake to a green that slopes back to front. Watch the wind and don't be afraid to take a bogey, as this is one of the finest, most difficult holes in Texas.Getting there : From I-45 north, take Hwy. 105 ( Exit 87) and head west.

The short design features generous fairways and prominent bunkering around the undulating greens. Lakes and ponds have been added over the years and impact play on most holes. Trees have also been added over the years to spice up the flat, prairie-like course.No. 9 is one of the toughest holes, a 440-yard par 4 that doglegs and has water.

Its riverside location guarantees water on a few holes and there are strategically placed bunkers throughout. There is also the occasional multi-tiered green to watch out for.

However many of the other par 4s are well under 400 yards. Not only are there birdie opportunities on the short par 4s, but all of the par 3s are under 200 yards, three of which should require no more than a medium-length iron.

The bent-grass greens are in nice shape and hold shots well. As you might expect, the fairways are firm and the grass can get bare in some areas.

5753,Wildflower Country Club,"Wildflower opened in 1987, and is one of Leon Howard’s better designs, featuring outstanding views of the central Texas landscapes, loads of water, and some of the best holes in this part of the state. While Howard established a reputation for basic, down-and-dirty courses in the 60s and 70s, this modern, challenging track is more of a complete golf experience.The design incorporates numerous water hazards, including many natural ponds that grace the rolling terrain. The fairways are fairly generous, and most of the greens have deceptive undulations.During the round you’ll notice the long, challenging par 4s. Particularly the 405 yard No. 11, where a creek cuts into the fairway twice, framing the landing area off the tee. No. 3 is also tough, playing 446 yards and forcing another carry of a creek that cuts into the fairway. The 17th is another solid par 4–not as long, but picturesque because the green is completely surrounded by water.Finally, the feature that rounds out the experience at Wildflower is the great condition of the course, enhanced by the new irrigation system that keeps the fairways lush and the greens healthy and rolling true.Getting there : From I-35 north, exit Midway Drive and turn left.

There is very little water on the golf course but the layout doesn't need it with its variety of elevation changes and numerous strategically placed sand bunkers situated along the greensides and fairways. The course demands accuracy and length, making it a formidable test for even seasoned players but players of all skill levels will enjoy the unrivaled scenery regardless of their score.

5776,Wichita Falls Country Club,"Fred Cooper, a Scottish immigrant, failed to find a suitable place to pursue his passion for golf when he settled in Wichita Falls in the early 1900s. So in 1914, the Wichita Falls Golf Club was formed with a 9-hole course and clubhouse on Victory Street.The club prospered through the 1920s, then fell on hard times during the Depression and was eventually turned over to the mortgage company in 1935. After several attempts to reorganize the club, Solon Featherston bought the entire club, made many improvements (first bent-grass greens in North Texas), and brought the facility back to profitability–due in part to slot machines installed during his tenure.The layout features a good mixture of holes, with a creek winding its way through the course and coming into play on more than half of the holes. A small lake also impacts a few holes. The fairways are tree-lined and there is a moderate amount of bunkering. While some tee shots require the precision for target golf, others are wide-open and offer generous landing areas.In late 1994, holes 14 and 15 were renovated. Jeff Brauer and Ralph Plummer have done work here periodically over the years.Make note of Ladies Day on Thursdays, as only ladies may tee off until 11:00 AM.Getting there : From Hwy 287 north, turn right at Midwestern, then drive 2 miles to the course.

5777,Texas National Golf Club,"Referred to as “the best piece of land left in America close to a downtown” by architect Tom Fazio, ultra-exclusive Dallas National sets a new standard for golf in Dallas. Created with the aim of obtaining a major championship, the course opened in 2002 in an amazing spot just 6 miles southeast of downtown in old Oak Cliff.The land itself was once owned by a cement company that was unable to effectively use the land, and the city of Dallas refused to zone the area because of an escarpment that slices the landscape. Result: the perfect opportunity to use the terrain for golf. But this isn’t just your normal run-of-the-mill upscale daily-fee development. The big boys play here--guys like Tom Hicks and Roger Staubach--and the price tag is rumored to be upwards of $160,000 to become one of 350 members.The high price tag, Fazio name, superb location, and stunning landscape combine to make one of the highest-profile facilities that has ever graced the great state of Texas. Dallasites would be shocked to learn of the spectacular elevation changes that reside so close to their flat city. Tipping out at over 7,300 yards, the par 72 track spreads out over almost 400 acres of limestone canyons, winding creek beds, and large plateaus, with up to 160 feet of elevation changes.Every hole is a signature hole, with Fazio’s signature bunkers defining the immaculate zoysia fairways. The natural appearance of the course is accentuated by the subtle reddish-tan cart paths, and artistic wooden bridges span the limestone ravines. Many holes offer elevated tees and impressive views of the city.And while the USGA gave the course one of the highest slope ratings ever (155), which is sure to help the club attract a big-time tournament, wealthy hacks can enjoy themselves from one of the other six remaining sets of tees.Getting there : Just east of Loop 12 between Keeneland Pkwy. and Jefferson Blvd. south of I-30.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/22677,,,,,,

With four sets of tees, the golf course is perfect for juniors and beginners who want some practice or avid golfers wanting a quick round.

This course is heavily wooded, with narrow, undulating fairways and a good combination of interesting tee shots. Howard’s design involves a few blind tee shots that play uphill, as well as a few from elevated tees that offer good views of the holes ahead. Water comes into play on half the holes, and the large greens are of medium speed.No. 8 is the signature, playing 590 yards and requiring two tough shots down a swerving fairway lined by a lake. The approach is nasty because of the skinny green that is covered by trees.Getting there : From I-30 east towards Greenville, take Hwy. 34 north to FM 2358.

6239,Wolf Creek Golf Resort,"Tucked away in a small mountain valley on the eastern side of Ogden's Wasatch Mountains is one of the best courses in the state. It is scenic, challenging, well maintained and isn't as busy as most courses in Northern Utah.The reason that the course is not as busy is that it is a little more than an hour away from Salt Lake City and there isn't an Interstate running to it. But with the highway construction happening now in the city you can probably drive to Wolf Creek faster than you can across town.Wolf Creek is located in the rolling hills just below the canyon that leads to the Powder Mountain Ski Resort. The high mountains surround everything in sight and the area is very scenic. In addition to the golf course Wolf Creek includes condos and time share units for summer and winter vacationers.The course is a mountain style course with elevated tees, sloped terrain and lots of wild areas in which to lose your ball. Wildlife is often seen on the course including deer, moose and fox. A more common critter on the course is the garter snake. They are harmless but can give you a scare if you disturb one hiding hiding in the long grass.Wolf Creek is probably one of the top five toughest courses in Utah. It's tough because of it's playing length, not it's actual length. On the card, the tee lengths of 6845 (gold) and 6465 (blue) don't seem to be outrageous, but the way the holes use the yardage will make you think a 300 yard drive is required to score well.Several of the toughest par 4 holes in Utah are on Wolf Creek. Numbers 3, 7 and 18 are well over 400 yards long and each has an up sloping fairway to an elevated green. Long uphill second shots put fairway woods into the hands of all but the longest players. And once you reach the greens in regulation you still have to putt out on fast greens that break severely toward the valley bottom.Other long holes include the par 3s. All but one of them is in the 180+ range and two of them have long carries over water. The par 5s are the most manageable holes but even they have elevated greens making the holes play longer.The fairways are generally wider on the holes that require long tee shots, but all holes have plenty of places that provide lost and unplayable lies. The front 9 seems to be wide open as there are very few trees, but the long meadow grasses off the fairways will hide a ball as well as the thick woods on the back 9.Be cautious when driving from the elevated tees. Since the ball flies further after being hit from high above the landing area, the distance a miss-hit shot draws or fades will be exaggerated and you could end up missing the fairway. This is especially true on holes 1 and 10.Wolf Creek Golf Course is a tough challenge for the best golfers without being overly penal for mid handicap golfers. Beginners may find it over powering. Although the green fees are about $5 more than the average public course, Wolf Creek Golf resort offers a great value for the experienced golfer.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12779,,,,,,
6240,Oakridge Country Club,"The golf course at Oakridge Country Club, located between Salt Lake and Ogden, has a traditional layout with many mature oak trees that can greatly affect the game. The tight course is an interesting mix of par 3s and par 4s with some par 5s thrown in as well. There are some water hazards that come into play in the form of a lake and bunkers protect several of the greens. Long, straight shots are needed to do well at Oakridge Country Club.

This tricky hole first requires a drive over water to a generous landing area before doglegging left to another landing area that is tightly lined with trees, water, and Indian mounds.

It is on the shorter side at 6,000 yards, at least by today's standards, but it offers plenty of challenges even without having the length. Strategically placed bunkers lurk beside the greens and the rolling terrain guarantees some tricky lies. The third and eighth are two of Beaver Dam Country Club's particularly memorable holes.

Skillful players could even try to use the contours to their advantage. Each hole has a bunkers but the bunkering is not excessive. In addition to the mounding and bunkering, the undulating terrain provides natural elevation changes. The golf course finishes with what is arguably its toughest hole. This monster par 5 is 620 yards from the back tees. It requires a drive over a ravine with a natural waste area to the left.

The Red and White nines make up the original golf course that opened in 1976 before the Blue nine was added in 1999. The Blue/Red Course combines the shortest nine, Blue, with the longest. The Red nine stretches to just over 2,600 yards, which is over 100 yards longer than the Blue. The Blue nine features a few holes with water and there are a few strategically placed bunkers to contend with. The back nine is arguably the most challenging at Mascoutin G.C. not only for the length but also because of the abundance of mature trees lining the fairways.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13552,,,,,,

The Oaks is routed through a diverse landscape of rolling hills covered with mature forests and lakes. It also winds alongside the Fox River.

Strategically placed sand traps and water hazards will further test your accuracy. The vigorous golf course is a good test but it is not so formidable that beginners should be intimidated. The par-4 second hole offers one of the most interesting risk-reward situations on the course. Golfers who are feeling confident with their driver can try to hit it past the big tree hanging over the right side of the fairway, but those who are less confident can play to the 100-yard marker and use a short iron from there.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13571,,,,,,

6799,Grand View Golf Club,"Grand View Golf Club in North Braddock is one of the area's most challenging layouts. The course's 160 acres were carefully carved from a woodland hilltop. From its perch, the golf course overlooks the Mon Valley with views stretching to the Edgar Thompson facility, Western Pennsylvania's first and last major steel mill. The distinctive layout will test your creative shot-making skills. It may seem relatively short at 6,111 yards from the back tees but it feels much longer thanks to the rolling fairways and undulating greens. The tight fairways are lined with cliffs, brush, and trees, leaving little room for error. You should also be prepared for forced carries and tricky doglegs. Grand View Golf Club can be punishing for the low handicapper, but high handicappers will find this course to be a unique test of their skills.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/11862,,,,,,

Sweeping elevation changes and glacial rocks that frame the course provide stunning views from tee to green. The more open holes have a spacious feel while the wooded ones are invitingly secluded. Golfers will have numerous strategically placed bunkers to contend with as well as many water hazards. The par-3 12th hole is the course's signature. This stunning hole incorporates dramatic elevation changes, forest, and wetlands for a challenge that you won't soon forget. The 15th is another hole that is as equally memorable, a u-shaped par 5 that is a double dogleg with a steeply sloped green.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13684,,,,,,

The classic layout has a character that you won't find on modern courses but its challenges and playability have withstood the test of time.

Thankfully, this monster is void of hazards. On the back No. 13 is feast or famine–a short par 5 at 483 yards, but a pond sits in the middle of the fairway. The ender at Cedar Creek goes 520 yards and is fairly manageable if you can keep it out of the trees.Getting there : From Hwy. 175 east, take the Kemp exit, and look for the signs to the course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3068,,,,,,

At 6,356 yards from the back tees, it is shorter than most championship courses you will find today but the layout still has plenty to offer besides length. There is a mix of holes that are wide-open and some that are framed by stands of mature trees. The rolling terrain provides subtle but tricky undulations in the greens and fairways as well as the occasional double-tiered green. One of the most memorable holes for both its level of difficulty and the scenery is the par-4 third. This no. 1 handicap hole plays along the lake and forces you to keep a close eye on the target.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13826,,,,,,

6976,Lake Wisconsin Country Club,"Lake Wisconsin Country Club is located on the outskirts of Prairie du Sac, just a 30-minute drive from both Madison and the Wisconsin Dells. The golf course is quite short at 5,881 yards, which makes it pleasantly walkable, but it is certainly not an easy course. The front nine plays across rolling hills while the back nine is centered upon the manmade Lake Wisconsin. The bunkering throughout the golf course is minimal, but it is strategic and fair. The small, fast greens have enough undulations to give them some character but they are not overly difficult though the tricky doglegs shaped by stands of mature trees will test your accuracy. The par-3 12th hole is the signature thanks to a challenging island tee. Lake Wisconsin Country Club's 16th hole also has a memorable tee shot between two towering oak trees followed by a short iron to a well guarded green that backs onto the Wisconsin River.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1789,,,,,,
6980,Meadowbrook Country Club,"Meadowbrook Country Club in Racine is just a short drive from Milwaukee and Kenosha as well as northeastern Illinois. The golf course is interwoven with a meandering creek that is connected to three ponds, all of which come into play on several holes throughout the course. The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings.

At only 6,300 yards from the back tees, it is shorter than most modern championship golf courses but don't let the yardage fool you. This course will test you on even its shortest holes. Every hole features either out-of-bounds or a lateral water hazard on one or both sides. Reedsburg Country Club's greens range from small to large but what they have in common is that they are all fast, undulating, and framed with pot bunkers.

Despite the difference in age and length, both golf courses provide rounds that are as scenic as they are challenging. The Springs is a Robert Trent Jones design, although the lush terrain of the Wisconsin River Valley also deserves credit. The course sweeps along the valley floor and incorporates Jones signature elements, including narrow landing areas and plenty of bunkering. Water hazards also come into play on almost every hole.

The Player Course is routed through the different neighborhoods and it is joined by the Wyboo Golf Club in the adjacent community of Deercreek Plantation. The 18-hole golf course stretches to just over 6,900 yards from the back tees. It is a great course for long hitters but it also forces golfers to employ creative strategies on each hole. The layout is tight in some spots and thanks to the interconnected lakes, water hazards come into play on several holes. It is a golf course that will make you think but at the same time it is playable for a range of different skill levels.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12253,,,,,,

It offers two 18-hole golf courses and one nine-hole course. Dick Wilson originally designed the Blue Course in 1958, but in 2004 Rees Jones did a complete renovation. Jones reshaped all of the course's greens, creating several with multiple tiers, and he also rebuilt many of the tees, which are all now square. The fairways and greenside bunkers were completely reconstructed as well to provide a greater challenge. The signature hole is the par-4 16th, which poses a formidable threat since it plays right into prevailing wind. The 14th is also memorable for its treacherous water hazard.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/28155,,,,,,

The golf course is one of two at the resort, the other being Le Diable, or the Devil. While the other course may draw inspiration from it, Le Geant is definitely a more difficult challenge.

Originally designed by Stanley Thompson in 1929, it has become one of the most popular golf courses in Quebec. In 1998, the scenic course was designated as an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary. The layout is considered one of the toughest in the province. The elevation changes throughout the course offer scenic mountain views but they also guarantee that a flat lie will be hard to find. There are a few water hazards on the golf course but the challenge comes mostly from the well guarded greens. In addition to the course, there is also a driving range and chipping and putting greens.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/28232,,,,,,

It is not often played or heard of because the club is reputed to be one of the most exclusive in the country. The golf course is laid across the east slope of Mount Bruno. The tree-lined fairways and heavily bunkered greens carefully follow the natural undulation of the landscape, featuring a good amount of elevation changes that often cause the ball the break in a different direction than what you're expecting. Mount Bruno's signature hole is the par-4 13th, which sits at the highest point on the course, offering a spectacular view of the surrounding valley. The tee shot plays downhill and then requires an uphill approach to an elevated green that slopes to the left and is flanked by bunkers on the right.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/28300,,,,,,

The layout features fairly large greens that are fast and undulating and there are narrow fairways, some of which are lined with trees. Water hazards come into play on five holes and there are white sand bunkers throughout the golf course.

The front nine has numerous water hazards and plays a bit longer than the back nine due to a handful of lengthy par 5s.

Duntroon Highlands Golf Club's fairways are fairly wide and there are trees bordering some. The hilly terrain provides some undulation in the greens, which are fast and vary in size. The golf course begins with scenic views but as it moves towards lowland forest on the back nine, the layout becomes considerably more challenging.

8512,Fairview Golf & Country Club,"Heritage Ranch serves up an especially challenging par 72, 6,988-yard Arthur Hills design that rolls through the oaks and pecans just outside of Fairview. And while it’s part of a gated, active-adult residential community, the course is open to the public and especially fun because it integrates well with the neighborhood. Houses line some fairways, but a fair number of holes provide that natural, rural feel that is always so welcome on a golf course.While the course is not particularly demanding off the tees, the real challenge at Heritage Ranch comes from the mound-shaped greens. If your irons aren’t dialed in, you’ll be working hard for ups and downs.No. 1 is a unique opener because it bends left down to a fairway and green that aren’t visible from the tee. Big drives can get close, but the recommended play is to take a long iron and draw it over the hill.The par 5s on the front are nice holes. No. 3 doglegs right and requires a good tee shot, followed by a relatively easy second shot into a widening fairway toward the hole. The trick is nailing the short iron (almost a blind shot) into the elevated green guarded by bunkers on the front. No. 7 is longer and offers a good chance for birdie, again because of its wide-open nature.No. 16 is the signature hole: a par 3 masterpiece that plays along a natural spring waterfall. You’ll need to nail a long iron over the valley and avoid the trees that overhang the fairway from the right.No. 18 is a good finisher–it’s a long par 4 that doglegs left around a few large fairway bunkers, then works its way uphill to an elevated, mound-shaped green surrounded by bunkers. Ups and downs are possible here if you miss the green back left, which is easy to do when you approach with a fairway wood.Getting there : Only 20 miles northeast of Dallas, take I-75 north to the Stacy Road exit, then turn right and drive to the dead end. The road jogs to the left, then right, and continues as Stacy Road. The entrance is 2 miles down on the left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/22891,,,,,,

8760,Twin Rivers Golf Club,"At Twin Rivers Golf Club experience a course that combines the natural beauty of Florida with a consistent test of shot-making abilities. Nestled between two rivers this golf club offers eighteen unique and challenging holes surrounded by environmentally protected areas.The fairways are well defined, and the greens, surrounded by mounds and pairs or trios of large bloomy bunkers, provide ample targets. Most holes encourage the player to favor one side of the fairway or green over the other, steering away from large and obvious hazards such as lakes, trees, or the large, flat bunkers.All of this adds up to a very nice and playable course that tips out at only 6,636 yards and thus, due particularly to the price, is a first page recommendation for those seeking public golf in Orlando.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15876,,,,,,

The golf course has matured beautifully over the years with help of major renovations to the design, irrigation, and drainage systems. The layout has rolling fairways that are lined with trees. It is still highly walkable though, since the undulations in the landscape are gentle, which is not to say it does not have its challenges. There are five water hazards and 13 strategically placed sand traps as well as smaller greens that demand accuracy.

The par-67 course is gentle enough for beginners and juniors, which makes it a great option for families. The golf course originally opened with only one nine in 1967. The front nine has remained largely unaltered over the years, but the back nine that was added later enhanced the course with several challenging elements. The contrast between the player-friendly front nine and the tougher back nine make for an interesting round. Richmond Centennial Golf Club is mostly flat though you will come across a few subtle but tricky slopes.

Every hole has a different feel to it, which guarantees plenty of variety throughout the course. The nine-hole layout is diverse enough to appeal to players of all skill levels. It's challenging enough for advanced players while still being gentle enough for beginners. There are several memorable holes, including the par-5 fifth, which is a tricky double dogleg and the par-3 seventh, which is almost entirely enclosed by water. Sandy Row Golf Club is great for a quick round, but another advantage of the split-tee system is that it allows the course to be played like an 18-hole course, where golfers are confronted with a different tee shot the second time around.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/27858,,,,,,

Bear Creek G.C. has always been known for its excellent greens, which have a reputation for being some of the state's finest putting surfaces.

The layout starts out gently enough until you get to the par-4 sixth, which is the first in a series of four tricky holes that plunge into a valley. The highlight of these four holes is the signature ninth, a par 5 that is entirely flanked by water on the right side.

The generous fairways, many of which are doglegs, are flanked with rough areas and there are numerous ponds and lakes that come into play. Surrounded by trees and bunkers, the small greens demand accuracy. It may be a short layout, but this formidable golf course requires careful course management, proper club selection, and solid short game skills.

The DGV Golf & Nature certificate in silver confirms this success.A varied round of golf awaits you on a course that will give you a lot of pleasure, but also requires a tactical game.We hope you have a great game!",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/31043,,,,,,

9317,"Bad Bevensen, Golf Club","Golf course""Golf is a way to find yourself""The Held family deliberately chose this motto from Rymond Federman for the Bad Bevensen golf course: The course, in the middle of a rural idyll, invites you to relax and play golf in a family atmosphere.As soon as you arrive at the course in the Secklendorf district, you feel like you're on vacation: The long oak avenue paved with cobblestones leads to a half-timbered Lower Saxon farm, horses neigh, and an antique shop invites you to browse. Past the beautiful things, you walk along the oak grove to the clubhouse - in true half-timbered style.A friendly welcome, perhaps a quick purchase in the pro shop, and then you can start your round. The precise allocation of starting times - even during the week - means there is no crowding at the tee.After a few strokes on the driving range and a few skillful chips and putts, you head to the first tee. You get a first impression of the course at tee 1: a dogleg to the right over meadows means that many a short tiger line drive disappears among the Heidschnucken. Precise play is required across the entire course, scattered drives quickly end up in the dense forest, in the numerous bunkers and lakes. A course that is certainly difficult; played tactically, however, it is an absolute must for every golfer. Add to that the beautiful heath landscape through which the 18 completely differently designed holes with their well-kept fairways and greens run. After the game, you can relax wonderfully on the club terrace with a view of the course. Anyone who wants to can join one another at the long tables. The boss is also always up for a chat. He is happy to talk about the beginnings at the club, the daily maintenance of the course or give tips for your own game.A successful day of golf is coming to an end - a shame, actually, some holes could certainly have been played differently...",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/31322,,,,,,

In fact, the island itself came about in the early 1900s as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cut the ship channel and piled mud from the bottom of Sabine Lake.Getting there : Once on Pleasure Island, look for the water tower on that looks like a golf ball sitting on a tee.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/22741,,,,,,

He played loose with the length, giving Dunfermline five par 5s and five par 3s, an unusual combo that gives the golf course lots of variety from hole to hole.

The inward 9 holes carry fewer hazards but the Findon burn continues to create problems at the fifteenth and eighteenth.Arguably the fifteenth is the 'signature hole' of the course. First, the tee shot has to be accurate to cope with the right to left dog leg and then the approach shot, from a down hill lie, has to carry the Findon burn which, moat like, guards the entrance to the green.
