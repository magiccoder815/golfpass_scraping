Jones closely followed the natural contours of the rugged terrain, creating a golf course that blends seamlessly into the landscape. It shares a home with an abundance of wildlife as well including deer, black bears, and a variety of indigenous birds. Douglas firs blanket the course along with outcroppings of exposed granite rock. The generous fairways are lined with trees and deep bunkers are strategically placed throughout.

The par-71 layout is routed through dense groves of mature, towering trees. They loom above the fairways and provide a backdrop for nearly every hole. When the trees are combined with the golf course's small, undulating greens, the layout becomes a true test of your accuracy. In addition to the golf course, Lacombe also offers a driving range and a practice putting green with a bunker.",https://www.golflacombe.com/,,,,,,

The course measures a manageable 6,600 yards from the back tees and is spread across mostly flat terrain, making it a good golf course to walk. The front nine is more wooded with trees tightly lining the fairways while the back nine has fewer trees but more water hazards than the front. Meandering creeks zigzag across the fairways and several large ponds make for difficult carries. Once you reach the greens, you'll be met with subtle but tricky breaks and slopes.
