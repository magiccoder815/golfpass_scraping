13161,Oak Hills Country Club,"""Oak Hills is classic golf architecture at its finest,"" says Carl Bielstein, La Cantera's director of golf, about Oak Hills Country Club's heritage and its noted architect, A.W. Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.oakhillscc.com/,,,,,,

The course originally opened in 1927 as a nine-holer but was renovated and lengthened in the 1980s but the front nine wasn't added until 2004. Only a few holes remained from the original nine-hole course, but they play just as they did in the 20s. The newer front nine has a link-style design that demands accuracy off the tee with 29 sand traps strategically placed throughout the nine holes. There are a variety of other hazards as well. As you move onto the back nine, the golf course's character changes completely. The holes have a traditional design and they are much more wooded with mature trees framing almost every hole, just waiting to knock down an errant tee shot or missed approach.",https://www.golfrrcc.com/,,,,,,

It is considered one of the best nine-hole golf courses in the Greater Dayton and Cincinnati area with a reputation built on its consistently good conditions Although it is short at just under 2,600 yards, there are sculpted bunkers that pack as much of a punch as any full-length course. The course is a great option for a quick round that still offers a challenge. Forest Hills Country Club also provides a great transitional round for beginning golfers looking for more than your average nine-hole course.",https://www.foresthillsclub4me.com/lander,,,,,,

The par-72 course that exists today tumbles across a variety of elevation changes that range from subtle to dramatic. The golf course is mostly wide open, putting it at the mercy of the prevailing winds. On particularly blustery days, Crystal Woods Golf Club is quite demanding. The 12th is the course’s signature and it even has a reputation for being the most difficult hole in McHenry County. It’s tempting to be distracted by the beautiful view from the elevated tee but this tough hole requires your full attention. The double-tiered green rises dramatically from front to back, often demanding three or more putts.",https://www.crystalwoodsgc.com/,,,,,,
13351,Woodstock Country Club,"Woodstock Country Club is one of New England's top destinations for visitors, earning a spot on Golf Magazine's list of top 100 golf resorts in the world.

The golf course has a classic design that stretches to just over 6,000 yards from the back tees. Though the holes may seem short by modern standards, you'll soon find out that they require thought and will test your shot-making skills. Water comes into play in the form of a long, meandering creek that traverses the length of the course. It feeds into a large lake that comes into play on the 12th and 13th holes. It's a challenging golf course but not overly difficult for the average player.",https://www.woodstockinn.com/,,,,,,

Only 1/4 mile away from the ocean, the back nine is a more open layout similar to Dye's PGA West course and play is influenced by the prevailing ocean wind.Prestwick features 8 holes where water comes into play.Over 1.3 million cubic yards of earth were moved in creating towering Scottish berms, stairway and church pew bunkers, and undulating greens. In addition, more than 10,000 railroad ties were used to create another classic Dye design.

The country club sits just 10 minutes outside of downtown Cincinnati.A Scottish golfer and designer, Bendelow created several Midwest courses. Bendelow designed 800-plus North American courses, working with land he was assigned: In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, architects didn't get their turf, rocks and water features trucked in. Born Sept. 2, 1868, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bendelow began golfing when he was 9 years old, with his dad at the Balgownie Links, which now goes by Royal Aberdeen Golf Club - founded in 1780, Royal Aberdeen Golf Club is the world's sixth-oldest, and it's clear that Bendelow had rich inspiration to draw on back in Scotland.After a round of golf at the Western Hills Country Club, head back to the Grill Porch for nibbles and sips.",https://www.westernhillscc.com/,,,,,,

Oak Hurst is also well known for its large, well-bunkered, undulating greens and water that comes into play on over half of the holes.The number-one-rated hole is No. 10, a challenging 595-yard par 5 that welcomes golfers who’ve allowed their concentration to wane at the turn.

13679,Forest Hills Country Club,"Opened in 1918, Forest Hills Country Club is Middletown's oldest course and it is one of the oldest in the state. The course is nestled amongst mature native trees, running adjacent to the Great Miami River, which comes into play on a few holes. It is considered one of the best nine-hole golf courses in the Greater Dayton and Cincinnati area with a reputation built on its consistently good conditions Although it is short at just under 2,600 yards, there are sculpted bunkers that pack as much of a punch as any full-length course. The course is a great option for a quick round that still offers a challenge. Forest Hills Country Club also provides a great transitional round for beginning golfers looking for more than your average nine-hole course.",https://www.foresthillsclub4me.com/lander,,,,,,

13696,Western Hills Country Club,"Since 1912, Western Hills Country Club has ranked among Cincinnati's swankier private clubs, with an 18-hole course designed by golf architect Thomas Bendelow - nongolfers can watch from the dining room - as well as a junior-Olympic swimming pool. The country club sits just 10 minutes outside of downtown Cincinnati.A Scottish golfer and designer, Bendelow created several Midwest courses. Bendelow designed 800-plus North American courses, working with land he was assigned: In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, architects didn't get their turf, rocks and water features trucked in. Born Sept. 2, 1868, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bendelow began golfing when he was 9 years old, with his dad at the Balgownie Links, which now goes by Royal Aberdeen Golf Club - founded in 1780, Royal Aberdeen Golf Club is the world's sixth-oldest, and it's clear that Bendelow had rich inspiration to draw on back in Scotland.After a round of golf at the Western Hills Country Club, head back to the Grill Porch for nibbles and sips.",https://www.westernhillscc.com/,,,,,,

13756,Bent Tree Golf Club,"The lush, rolling terrain occupied by Bent Tree Golf Club was sculpted into one of the most popular championship golf courses in central Ohio. Dennis Griffiths, the course's architect, seamlessly blended the design with the natural features of the landscape. The abundant natural water hazards come into play on half the holes and Griffiths strategically incorporated several well placed bunkers. The terrain's gentle undulations provide some interesting slope in the greens that place a priority on accuracy. Bent Tree Golf Club's par-4 eighth hole is especially demanding. It may be short at only 334 yards but it is surrounded by bunkers on all sides. It is followed by another tricky par 4 that requires both distance and accuracy in order to navigate the tree-lined fairway uphill to an undulating green faced with bunkers to the front and back.",https://www.benttreegc.com/,,,,,,
13761,Wolf Run Golf Club,"Wolf Run Golf Club is one of south Reno's most popular courses. The course is situated amid the Sierra Foothills, tumbling across a picturesque desert landscape sprinkled with native flora. The layout has many risk-reward opportunities and the par-3 holes are especially fun. The hilly terrain is as scenic as it is challenging, providing some tricky uneven lies and there is a meandering creek that slithers along the fairways. Though it's wide open, the golf course requires a bit of accuracy and some good course management. The elevated tees offer some spectacular views as well as some intimidating approaches to the fast, undulating greens. In addition to the golf course, Wolf Run also has a practice facility with a driving range and putting and chipping greens. You can also get your clubs repaired on site.",https://www.wolfrungolfclub.com/,,,,,,

13765,Abilene Country Club,"The par-70 Club Course at Abilene Country Club dates back to 1920, but was redesigned in 1993 by George Williams and Garrett Gill, who reconstructed 10 holes. Pro golfers such as Tommy Bolt, Charles Coody, Don Cherry, Mike Standly, and Bob Estes have all spent time here.The fairways are generous and the layout is loaded with bunkers. The track’s first hole of note is the beautiful 360-yard par 4 No. 5, which doglegs left. Locals aim at the three oaks on the right side of the fairway and work their draw. The most difficult hole is the 390-yard par 4 ninth hole, which plays uphill into the wind with an approach that must carry water. Hole 14 (190 yards) is also tough, requiring a long iron with the wind–which makes it impossible at times to hold the green, and is especially treacherous with water front and left of the green.Getting there : From I-20 west, exit 83/84 and take the Buffalo Gap exit. Turn left onto Industrial, then turn right when you come to Treadway. The course is on the right side of the street.",https://www.abilenecountryclub.com/,,,,,,
