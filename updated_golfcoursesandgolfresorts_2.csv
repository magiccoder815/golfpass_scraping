The tricky doglegs, which are mostly par 4s, will force you to think carefully about your club selection, and to top it all off, water makes an appearance on almost every hole.

This monster doglegs left inside a cliff that runs along the right side. Out-of-bounds is left, and a fairway bunker resides about a lob wedge from the narrow green, which is bolstered from behind by more bunkers.No. 18 is one of the more interesting finishing holes that you’ll come across, featuring two dogleg fairways, one right and one left, that both involve dealing with the creek that splits the two routes. The tee shot right is more favorable, since it is void of fairway bunkers like the ones on the left side. However, this option involves carrying two bunkers and the creek on the approach.Getting there : From I-20 west, take the Bryant/Irvin Rd. exit and turn left. Drive 2.5 miles to the course.

Although there is an abundance of trees, the course still has many wide-open areas. The pristine white sand bunkers and colorful wildflowers are a beautiful contrast to the lush green of the course. The layout is not particularly long, but golfers should be prepared for a challenging round of target golf.

The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times.

Water is in play on 13 holes, the pine-lined fairways feature numerous elevation changes, and the greens are small targets.The best hole on the front is No. 4, about a 180-yarder all over water, but you're bound to notice the opening set of holes that feature two monster par 5s. The 583-yard No. 3 bends left around a lake and plays to a tricky little green nestled against water's edge.On the back, you'll remember the ender-an almost 600-yard tree-lined monster. And the preceding 203-yard No. 17 isn't the way to build confidence for the finisher. Together the two finishing holes can absolutely destroy your round.Getting there : From Houston, take Hwy. 59 north. Exit Champions Dr. and you will see the course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3127,,,,,,

Over the decades that the course has been open, it has hosted a number of professional players and celebrities ranging from Arnold Palmer to Will Smith. George C. Thomas, Jr., who created the Riviera, collaborated with Billy Bell to design the original golf course but Jay Morrish made the layout considerably more challenging with renovations in 1988. Ten years later, two holes from the original Thomas/Bell layout that were lost during a redesign following WWII were completely restored and incorporated into the layout. The challenging golf course is very narrow in some spots and it features undulating greens that putt fast and true.

The former is the short 6th hole, with a pot bunker in the middle of the sweeping, multi-tiered green. The latter: the 10th, whose broad fairway and strategic bunkering gives way to one of the toughest-to-hit putting surfaces in the world. Even the best golfers in the world routinely make scores from 2 to 8 there.In addition to the PGA Tour’s annual Genesis Invitational, Riviera has a considerable major championship pedigree, including a U.S. Open (1948) and two PGA Championships (1983, 1995).",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14936,,,,,,

The private, 18-hole golf course was designed by J. Press Maxwell and opened in 1965. The traditional links-style layout has a hilly front nine but a relatively flat back nine. The course features challenges that test even experienced golfers, but beginning golfers receive enjoyment from the course as well from the right tees.

The Lake Course is scenic and less demanding than the other courses, but there are still some challenges. From this course, golfers can view the entire range from Pike's Peak to Long's Peak. The Valley Course is the most difficult of Pinery Country Club's three courses, possessing the hardest shot at the club. Both courses wind through houses.

It serves as a refuge for wildlife, native plants, and also golfers looking for a peaceful game of golf. The golf course is nestled in the foothills of the Rockies and the wildlife includes black bears, coyotes, deer, elk, and many more. In its commitment to preserving the natural terrain and wildlife, the Sanctuary limits the golf course to only 9,000 rounds per year and it is invite only. The exclusivity is understandable though since the golf course offers not only beautiful views but also a challenging and fun game of golf. The greens are large and undulating and play fast. The fairways are narrow and surrounded by trees. The Sanctuary's signature hole is the first, which is a lengthy par-5 with a 250-foot drop off the tee.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/4293,,,,,,

Towering forests of pine and aspen frame the rolling fairways and manicured greens on this scenic layout. The crystal clear creeks and trout-filled lakes are a striking contrast to the lush green of the course and the snow-capped peaks in the distance. The golf course is known for more than its scenery though, its challenging design is a test for all skill levels. The steep-faced bunkers have deeply furrowed edges, which can be tricky but they also serve to contain tee shots that might have an increased carry because of the course's dramatic elevations. There are also water hazards to contend with on several holes.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/16441,,,,,,

Their thoughtful placement makes up the bulk of the layout's challenges. There are ponds that come into play on six holes as well as tall native grasses that appear along the fairways and greens.

In the late 1980s, the course became known for its improving condition, and that reputation has held true over the years.The front nine is shorter and a little easier than the front, its toughest hole being the 200 -yard No. 3 over water. No. 14 typifies the longer back: a 576-yard marathon with water on either side of the fairway.Getting there : From Dallas, take I-175 south, then turn right on Hwy. 274.

The holes are fairly straightforward though there are some fairways that have very narrow landing areas that will test the accuracy of even the best golfers. Numerous bunkers are strategically placed along the undulating greens and water also comes into play on the occasional hole. The golf course starts out gently but becomes progressively more challenging on the back nine.

Water hazards come into play on six holes at Cherokee Run Golf Club and there are nearly 100 strategically placed bunkers. The course's signature hole is the par-3 third.

The improvements focused on the front nine (which is still more open than the back), spicing up the layout with bunkering, tree additions, and adjustments to greens.Water comes into play on 14 of 18 holes, and the course is quite long if you play from the tips. The best hole on the front is No. 3, a long par 5 that plays almost 600 yards. The narrow fairway chutes between water on the left and bunkers on the right, and the small green slopes severely to the water on the left side.The more interesting back nine offers a nice stretch of golf on holes 13-15. No. 14 is the most scenic on the course because it plays downhill at least 75 feet to a green surrounded on three sides by water. The 387-yard 18th is the perfect finishing hole–not too long but plenty challenging.Getting there : From I-635 east, take the Dallas North Tollway and exit Westgrove.

No. 3 is also tough, playing 446 yards and forcing another carry of a creek that cuts into the fairway. The 17th is another solid par 4–not as long, but picturesque because the green is completely surrounded by water.Finally, the feature that rounds out the experience at Wildflower is the great condition of the course, enhanced by the new irrigation system that keeps the fairways lush and the greens healthy and rolling true.Getting there : From I-35 north, exit Midway Drive and turn left.

The two hired the eclectic Scotsman Desmond Muirhead to design the course on 190 acres of former cotton fields.In the 1980s, the LPGA and Senior PGA tours frequently hosted tournaments at Bent Tree, and the course was eventually renovated in 1990. The improvements focused on the front nine (which is still more open than the back), spicing up the layout with bunkering, tree additions, and adjustments to greens.Water comes into play on 14 of 18 holes, and the course is quite long if you play from the tips. The best hole on the front is No. 3, a long par 5 that plays almost 600 yards. The narrow fairway chutes between water on the left and bunkers on the right, and the small green slopes severely to the water on the left side.The more interesting back nine offers a nice stretch of golf on holes 13-15. No. 14 is the most scenic on the course because it plays downhill at least 75 feet to a green surrounded on three sides by water.

The layout is comprised of nine par 4s, eight par 3s, and one par 5. The course rewards accuracy and good shot placement, meaning it's not strength that matters but being able to strategize. The seventh hole is a memorable par 3 that appears simple enough thanks to a massive and seemingly inviting green, but the problem isn't hitting the green but getting your shot on the same level as the pin.

Smyers' bunkers are dramatic, sweeping hollows of sand that intimidate, deceive, direct play and frame the course's landing areas and greens. Often, they make holes look more difficult than they really are. As one architecture editor wrote, ""Not since MacKenzie or Tillinghast has a golf course architect used bunkering to make such bold statements, express such flair, instill such fear.""Old Memorial Golf Club is a pure, undisturbed sanctuary of golf, where members and guests can get away from the hectic pace of life to enjoy friendly competition, the camaraderie of golfers from diverse backgrounds, and the free exchange of ideas.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15588,,,,,,

Although it is seemingly tame at 6,273 yards, it plays much tougher. The golf course features more elevation changes than the resort's other course, the Saddlebrook. The undulating, tree-lined fairways were designed to mimic a hilly New England course but the moss-covered cypresses, palm trees, and marshy swamplands are true to the Florida landscape. The layout features tight fairways framed with contoured mounding and the occasional water hazard but the most formidable challenge comes from the bunkers strategically placed along the undulating greens. The approaches to the tiered greens, which are often sloped from back to front, demand accuracy. Golfers should be prepared to use every club in their bag and employ a variety of different shots.",http://www.saddlebrook.com/,,,,,,

The par-71 layout has a traditional design that features narrow, tree-lined fairways and water hazards in the form of several small ponds and a meandering creek. There are also strategically placed bunkers lurking along the greensides. The golf course's par 4s are particularly memorable.

Six of the par 4s play over 400 yards and a few par 3s measure over 200 yards, which also helps the course feel longer. Water hazards and bunkers come into play but they are balanced by large greens and wide fairways that make for easier approaches. Although beginners won't feel out of place and there are four different sets of tees, the golf course boasts several tricky holes that will challenge even the best players.

Only 1/4 mile away from the ocean, the back nine is a more open layout similar to Dye's PGA West course and play is influenced by the prevailing ocean wind.Prestwick features 8 holes where water comes into play.Over 1.3 million cubic yards of earth were moved in creating towering Scottish berms, stairway and church pew bunkers, and undulating greens. In addition, more than 10,000 railroad ties were used to create another classic Dye design. Dramatic elevation changes ranging up to thirty feet add an exceptional feature to this coastal location.Prestwick has been recognized as one of South Carolina's top golf courses and remains enjoyable with extremely limited non-member play and great year-round course conditioning.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12326,,,,,,
12918,Freeport Country Club,"Freeport Country Club is conveniently located just 20 minutes from Portland, Lewis-Auburn, and Brunswick-Topsham and it is also only minutes from one of Maine's most popular attractions, the L.L. Bean flagship store. Freeport itself is also a charming destination, with plenty of shopping and activities available. The nine-hole layout is gentle enough for beginners but there are still a few challenges in store. The holes are tight and golfers will be confronted with the occasional elevated green. The course is known for having some of the area's best maintained greens. There are also three ponds that come into play. Whether you play a nine-hole round or a full 18 holes, the golf course is a great price, especially for the country club-quality. The well conditioned driving range at the club is also popular.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/6834,,,,,,

12921,Eagle Ridge Inn & Resort(East Course at Eagle Ridge Inn & Resort ),"Situated just outside of Galena, Eagle Ridge Resort & Spa offers three 18-hole championship courses and one nine-hole course that are nestled amongst rolling, wooded hills. The General, North, and South Courses are the championship layouts while the East Course is the nine-hole course. The East is not long at 2,648 yards but don't underestimate its level of difficulty. Accuracy is extremely important on this course and putting requires a deft touch. It offers the same excellent conditions and design that the championship golf courses are known for. The course acts as a good warm-up for the longer courses, but it is also great for beginners since it offers the same challenges but on a smaller scale. The finishing hole is a short par 4 that is a great scoring hole.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/470,,,,,,

The golf course blends seamlessly with the scenic surroundings. Strategically placed bunkers fiercely protect the greens and golfers should also be prepared for some tricky forced carries. The fairways are generous and forgiving though. The course is a fair test but it is especially tough on windy days. The interior, tree-lined holes contrast nicely with the waterfront holes and they have the added benefit of protection from the prevailing sea breezes. North Shore Country Club is a player-friendly layout that both beginners and seasoned players can enjoy, which is why it has become one of the Outer Banks' most popular golfing destinations.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10239,,,,,,

The greens are elevated, so take enough club.Other notes: Depending on who you talk to, the course may or may not be open to the public, but we’ll go with the Chamber of Commerce’s friendly recommendation that out-of-towners are welcome at HCC. When we originally called to schedule a round that we ended up avoiding, we were abruptly told by the older gentleman who answered the phone that the course wasn’t open to the public.

13005,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

The resulting layout blends in almost seamlessly with the natural landscape. The golf course is routed through forests of mature oak trees and around five sparkling lakes. The back nine plays along a meandering creek. Water hazards come into play on a total of 13 holes and there are nearly 50 bunkers strategically placed throughout. The golf course demands a fair amount of accuracy but it's not overly punishing if you're errant. The final hole plays from an elevated tee, requiring a carry over the creek in order to reach the green. In addition to the golf course, Oak Ridge also offers a practice facility with a driving range, two practice greens, and a practice bunker.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/5300,,,,,,

Pete Dye and his son P.B. collaborated to design the course, making it the only Dye design in the Chicago area. A well thought-out strategy will be greatly rewarded on this challenging layout and bad shots made without any thought will be severely punished. This is definitely not a golf course where you can just grip it and rip it. The fairways are fairly straight and forgiving, but most of the approach shots play to tricky elevated greens. There are also strategically placed bunkers framing the greens and water hazards come into play on several holes as well. Ruffled Feathers Golf Club's par 3s have a reputation for being particularly challenging.

At just over 6,300 yards, the golf course is not particularly lengthy but it still offers some formidable challenges. Water is a prominent feature of the course with ponds and a winding river coming into play on 12 holes. The greens are small and raised and the sculpted fairways are tightly lined with mature trees, demanding accuracy off the tee. Crane's Landing Golf Club's back nine is especially difficult thanks to the river, which runs along the entire left side of the 13th hole and also appears on no. 17, the course's longest hole.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/486,,,,,,

13161,Oak Hills Country Club,"""Oak Hills is classic golf architecture at its finest,"" says Carl Bielstein, La Cantera's director of golf, about Oak Hills Country Club's heritage and its noted architect, A.W. Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3302,,,,,,

Only a few holes remained from the original nine-hole course, but they play just as they did in the 20s. The newer front nine has a link-style design that demands accuracy off the tee with 29 sand traps strategically placed throughout the nine holes. There are a variety of other hazards as well. As you move onto the back nine, the golf course's character changes completely.

13350,Crystal Woods Golf Club,"Crystal Woods Golf Club dates back to the 1950s when it was opened as a nine-hole, par-37 course called Bit O’ Heather Golf Club, which it was known as until 1967 when the course was renamed and completely redesigned, which included the addition of another nine. The par-72 course that exists today tumbles across a variety of elevation changes that range from subtle to dramatic. The golf course is mostly wide open, putting it at the mercy of the prevailing winds. On particularly blustery days, Crystal Woods Golf Club is quite demanding. The 12th is the course’s signature and it even has a reputation for being the most difficult hole in McHenry County. It’s tempting to be distracted by the beautiful view from the elevated tee but this tough hole requires your full attention. The double-tiered green rises dramatically from front to back, often demanding three or more putts.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/5619,,,,,,
13351,Woodstock Country Club,"Woodstock Country Club is one of New England's top destinations for visitors, earning a spot on Golf Magazine's list of top 100 golf resorts in the world. Robert Trent Jones designed the course, taking advantage of the panoramic views of Kedron Valley and the scenic and varied terrain. The golf course has a classic design that stretches to just over 6,000 yards from the back tees. Though the holes may seem short by modern standards, you'll soon find out that they require thought and will test your shot-making skills. Water comes into play in the form of a long, meandering creek that traverses the length of the course. It feeds into a large lake that comes into play on the 12th and 13th holes. It's a challenging golf course but not overly difficult for the average player.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12924,,,,,,

Only 1/4 mile away from the ocean, the back nine is a more open layout similar to Dye's PGA West course and play is influenced by the prevailing ocean wind.Prestwick features 8 holes where water comes into play.Over 1.3 million cubic yards of earth were moved in creating towering Scottish berms, stairway and church pew bunkers, and undulating greens. In addition, more than 10,000 railroad ties were used to create another classic Dye design.

The golf course can be very demanding at times, specifically on the fourth hole. This par 4 is wooded from tee to green on both sides and requires a tee shot over a narrow creek before turning up a steep hill to a dramatically undulating green.

The layout is much like playing two golf courses in one with a front nine that is tightly lined with trees and a hillier back nine that wraps around a large lake.

13756,Bent Tree Golf Club,"The lush, rolling terrain occupied by Bent Tree Golf Club was sculpted into one of the most popular championship golf courses in central Ohio. Dennis Griffiths, the course's architect, seamlessly blended the design with the natural features of the landscape. The abundant natural water hazards come into play on half the holes and Griffiths strategically incorporated several well placed bunkers. The terrain's gentle undulations provide some interesting slope in the greens that place a priority on accuracy. Bent Tree Golf Club's par-4 eighth hole is especially demanding. It may be short at only 334 yards but it is surrounded by bunkers on all sides. It is followed by another tricky par 4 that requires both distance and accuracy in order to navigate the tree-lined fairway uphill to an undulating green faced with bunkers to the front and back.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1310,,,,,,
13761,Wolf Run Golf Club,"Wolf Run Golf Club is one of south Reno's most popular courses. The course is situated amid the Sierra Foothills, tumbling across a picturesque desert landscape sprinkled with native flora. The layout has many risk-reward opportunities and the par-3 holes are especially fun. The hilly terrain is as scenic as it is challenging, providing some tricky uneven lies and there is a meandering creek that slithers along the fairways. Though it's wide open, the golf course requires a bit of accuracy and some good course management. The elevated tees offer some spectacular views as well as some intimidating approaches to the fast, undulating greens. In addition to the golf course, Wolf Run also has a practice facility with a driving range and putting and chipping greens. You can also get your clubs repaired on site.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14834,,,,,,

13765,Abilene Country Club,"The par-70 Club Course at Abilene Country Club dates back to 1920, but was redesigned in 1993 by George Williams and Garrett Gill, who reconstructed 10 holes. Pro golfers such as Tommy Bolt, Charles Coody, Don Cherry, Mike Standly, and Bob Estes have all spent time here.The fairways are generous and the layout is loaded with bunkers. The track’s first hole of note is the beautiful 360-yard par 4 No. 5, which doglegs left. Locals aim at the three oaks on the right side of the fairway and work their draw. The most difficult hole is the 390-yard par 4 ninth hole, which plays uphill into the wind with an approach that must carry water. Hole 14 (190 yards) is also tough, requiring a long iron with the wind–which makes it impossible at times to hold the green, and is especially treacherous with water front and left of the green.Getting there : From I-20 west, exit 83/84 and take the Buffalo Gap exit. Turn left onto Industrial, then turn right when you come to Treadway. The course is on the right side of the street.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15637,,,,,,

14329,Meadowbrook Country Club,"Meadowbrook Country Club in Racine is just a short drive from Milwaukee and Kenosha as well as northeastern Illinois. The golf course is interwoven with a meandering creek that is connected to three ponds, all of which come into play on several holes throughout the course. The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings. Meadowbrook C.C. has hosted several events over the years, including numerous Wisconsin state opens.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1750,,,,,,

14371,Buffalo Creek Golf Club,"Highly touted Buffalo Creek has been praised for its layout, condition, and overall attention to detail. No matter who you talk to in the DFW area, they all seem to praise the superb condition of the course from tee to green. Offering a 7,078-yard par 71 Jay Morrish/Tom Weiskopf design, Buffalo Creek offers a good combination of holes: straight holes, dogleggers, uphill and downhill shots, and both long and short holes.One of the best features is the club’s method of using a pin location sheet to mark exactly where each pin is located on a particular day (up to six locations), which is unbelievably helpful to hacks who’ve never played the course before and have no feel for the look and contour of the greens.Getting there : Take I-30 east from Dallas and exit Ridge Rd.

The golf course also enjoys panoramic views of the Sacramento Valley. Massive rock outcroppings border the fairways, calling for some creative shot making. Accuracy is also a necessity with meandering creeks and bunkers coming into play on most holes. The layout is challenging but five sets of tees make the golf course approachable for a variety of skill levels.

They persevered with their idea and eventually established an 18-hole, par-72 course right in Cumberland Center. The golf course has a traditional layout that is heavily lined with trees. Accuracy is an important part of the round but if you can manage to hit straight, you'll have a good game. Strategically placed bunkers also lurk along the greensides and fairways. In addition to the golf course, there is a driving range and practice green. Val Halla Golf & Recreation Center is a scenic and more affordable alternative to other options in Portland.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/6821,,,,,,

14706,Hillcrest Golf Club,"Alvin's second country club opened in the 1960s, built by a man named Shorty Plaster who wanted to make the most of his land investment. Shorty was a hacker and his short course is designed to accommodate the lesser golfer with its executive-like 2,385-yard length.Plaster's design opens up with three par 3s, followed by another on No. 5. Every par 4 plays 350 yards or less, and the sole par 5 is only 475 yards. Not many non-par-3 9-holers are blessed with lights, but this one is. The same goes for the driving range, so you can definitely spend some hours at this nice little country course.Getting there : From I-45 south, exit Dixie Farm Rd. and turn right. Drive 8 miles to where it dead-ends, then turn on Hwy 35. Drive 8 miles to Fairway Dr. and turn left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2726,,,,,,

Be sure to build up your score on the player-friendly first half because greater accuracy will be required for the final stretch of the golf course. With plenty of variety among all of the holes, the layout will test your skill with different types of shots. There are a variety of elevation changes ranging from subtle to dramatic, providing tricky uphill and downhill lies. The contours are complemented by strategically placed bunkers that lurk along the challenging greens.

14716,Penobscot Valley Country Club,"Opened in 1924, Penobscot Valley Country Club in Orono, known locally as ""Penobby,"" has a classic design created by Donald Ross. Nestled in the rolling hills of central Main, the golf course runs alongside the river that created its namesake valley. The scenic landscape is covered with mature trees, which are concentrated along the undulating fairways. The original design was slightly tweaked in 2001 to make it both more challenging and more playable. The green sizes were reduced and bunkers were shifted or removed. The result was a golf course that is challenging enough for more advanced players but still gentle enough for beginners to approach with confidence. The classic elements of Ross' design still manage to shine though, which has cemented Penobscot Valley Country Club's status as a Maine tradition.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/6862,,,,,,

There have been many changes over the years, including opening to the public in 1965 and the addition of another nine holes in 1974. At just over 6,000 yards, it's a short course by modern standards but it's no pushover. The greens are known for being challenging and they are also some of the truest and smoothest putting surfaces you'll find in the area. Though length may not be required, accuracy and course management are essential. The hazards at Marshfield C.C. are mostly provided by the existing landscape, including the meandering creeks, mature trees, and rocky outcroppings, which are complemented by several strategically placed bunkers. Each hole offers a different test, beginning with a tough par 4. This dogleg left hole has a stream that cuts right through the center.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13737,,,,,,

14962,Bay Pointe Country Club,"Bay Pointe Country Club was known as Wareham Country Club when it first opened in 1964 up until 1988 when it underwent a major renovation, including the construction of the island green seventh hole, which is the golf course's signature. The club underwent yet another multi-million dollar renovation in 2012 when the club changed ownership. In the most recent renovation, hundreds of extraneous trees were cleared from the fairways in order to get it back into pristine condition. Although it's a seemingly short layout at just over 6,200 yards from the back tees, it actually plays much longer. The first two holes are laid across the hilliest portion of the terrain. Though you have a challenging start, the rest of the Bay Pointe golf course eases into a gentler landscape.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/7214,,,,,,

The golf course sprawls across gently rolling terrain laced with mature trees and marshland. The greens are large, making accurate pin placement essential, and there are also subtle breaks that can be difficult to read. Water hazards and strategically placed bunkers also come into play but the more challenging elements are balanced by the player-friendly fairways are wide and forgiving. There are five sets of tees on the golf course, allowing golfers to play to their own abilities. Much of Kettle Brook Golf Club's challenges will depend on which tee box you choose but most golfers will find that they have to employ the use of every club in their bag.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/25820,,,,,,

The greens vary in size and shape from hole to hole, reflecting the diversity of the terrain. They were also carefully shaped and angled to make the approaches especially challenging. More than 60 bunkers are strategically placed throughout the golf course and water hazards come into play on several holes. The eighth and 17th holes are challenging twin par 3s that share a large lake. They present golfers with the decision to either go for the green or play it safe, but the latter will be met with a much trickier shot if you want to make par. Wentworth Hills G.C. is tough but four different tee boxes make the course approachable for every skill level.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15899,,,,,,

Opened in 1956, the 18-hole course has a traditional layout that is shorter than most modern courses. Despite the relatively short length, there are plenty of challenges in store on this golf course. The greens are severely sloped and they play lightning fast. More often than not, you'll find that they're flanked by strategically placed bunkers as well. There are also water hazards that come into play on several holes. The golf course appeals to a wide range of skill levels since it's not overly punishing for high handicappers and there are risk-reward opportunities for more advanced players.

The layout features rolling fairways lined with trees and terraced greens framed by strategically placed bunkers. The golf course has a traditional design that is challenging but fair.

The ender is tough as well, featuring trees along the left, the river on the right, and that pesky creek that fronts the green.Other notes: A tenth hole was added after the river temporarily swallowed No. 8.

The terrain is mostly flat, making it a pleasant golf course to walk.

Rolling fairways and wind will challenge you, but the course's real test is on its greens.

Nicklaus fully utilized the natural features of the land, incorporating the subtle movement of the terrain, the wetlands, and the abundant mature oaks and pines. The blooming magnolias add a colorful accent to the already lush landscape. The course has a versatile mix of holes ranging from tight and short to long and open.

The golf course is not as seemingly easy as one would think since the open landscape is also subject to strong winds. There are also stands of mature trees throughout as well as waste areas that are waiting to swallow up errant shots. It is not a formidable test by any means but it is not a simple pitch-and-putt either. Players of all skill levels can get some good practice in at Riegelwood Country Club.",,,,,,,

15893,"Bay Club, The -East","Formerly known as Championship at East Bay Golf Course.Timpanogos Golf Club is in Provo about 1 hour south of Salt Lake City. The course is located on the Novell/Word Perfect campus which explains why there is an executive course in addition to the regular 18 hole course.One word describes the hazards at Timpanogos -- water. Water comes into play on almost every hole and there are several forced carries. This can be one of the most challenging (and frustrating) courses in the area if you're not hitting the ball straight. It's possible to empty your ball bag on this course on a bad day.Favorite holes are number 4 and number 10 (now some other number because the back nine was reordered during 1997). Number 4 is a par 4 which requires a blind tee shot over a marsh. Too short or left and you're dead in the marsh, too far right and you're either wet or are faced with a long second shot. Number 10 (maybe 12 now) is a par five that offers several ways to attack, all of them dangerous. If you go for the green in 2 you have to carry the entire length of a pond. To lay up you have to hit a narrow fairway and risk going too far through and out of bounds.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12822,,,,,,

Hills took advantage of not only the beautiful views afforded by the course's location right along the Assawomen Bay, but also the natural diversity of the terrain. He routed the front nine along the bay while the back nine borders the St. Martin's River, through mature hardwoods and pristine marshland. The golf course is home to the longest cart bridge in the country, stretching almost 1,500 feet to bring golfers from the bay-side holes to the marshland holes. It is also the only course in the U.S. with five consecutive holes playing to the same double green. The signature hole is the par-3 fifth, which requires a carry over a marsh to a nearly island green bordered by water on three sides.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/21438,,,,,,

Thankfully, this monster is void of hazards. On the back No. 13 is feast or famine–a short par 5 at 483 yards, but a pond sits in the middle of the fairway. The ender at Cedar Creek goes 520 yards and is fairly manageable if you can keep it out of the trees.Getting there : From Hwy. 175 east, take the Kemp exit, and look for the signs to the course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3068,,,,,,

16223,Innsbrook Resort & Conference Center,"Although it is located just west of St. Louis, Innsbrook Resort feels much more secluded with its sprawling landscape of rolling hills covered with towering trees and more than 100 lakes. The golf course's scenic and carefully preserved landscape has even been certified as an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary. Carved from the hillsides, the course offers dramatic elevation changes as well as scenic views of the surrounding countryside. Trees line the fairways and there are tricky, uneven lies throughout. Both accuracy and proper club selection will be required. Of the many lakes on the resort's 8,000 acres, 12 come into play on the golf course along with 30 strategically placed bunkers. The course offers a fair amount of challenge but beginners won't feel as though they are out of their league.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/8577,,,,,,

16264,Marshfield Country Club,"Opened in 1923, Marshfield Country Club was one of the first golf courses in the area. There have been many changes over the years, including opening to the public in 1965 and the addition of another nine holes in 1974. At just over 6,000 yards, it's a short course by modern standards but it's no pushover. The greens are known for being challenging and they are also some of the truest and smoothest putting surfaces you'll find in the area. Though length may not be required, accuracy and course management are essential. The hazards at Marshfield C.C. are mostly provided by the existing landscape, including the meandering creeks, mature trees, and rocky outcroppings, which are complemented by several strategically placed bunkers. Each hole offers a different test, beginning with a tough par 4. This dogleg left hole has a stream that cuts right through the center.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13737,,,,,,

The golf course is interwoven with a meandering creek that is connected to three ponds, all of which come into play on several holes throughout the course. The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings. Meadowbrook C.C. has hosted several events over the years, including numerous Wisconsin state opens.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1750,,,,,,

16298,Oak Hills Country Club,"""Oak Hills is classic golf architecture at its finest,"" says Carl Bielstein, La Cantera's director of golf, about Oak Hills Country Club's heritage and its noted architect, A.W. Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3302,,,,,,

16445,Colonial Country Club,"Colonial Country Club, located in Fort Worth on the southern banks of the Trinity River and near TCU, is one of the most historic golf clubs in Texas. The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times. Other multiple winners of this longstanding PGA Tour event include Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Nick Price and Ben Crenshaw.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/21496,,,,,,

16672,Oak Hills Country Club,"""Oak Hills is classic golf architecture at its finest,"" says Carl Bielstein, La Cantera's director of golf, about Oak Hills Country Club's heritage and its noted architect, A.W. Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3302,,,,,,

The layout is routed through freshwater lagoons and marshes, which means you'll be facing water on several holes. Rolling dunes provide subtle but challenging contours throughout the course as well. The terrain is tough enough but there are also the ever-present winds to contend with. For some scenic respite from this formidable test, scenic views of the Atlantic can be enjoyed on almost every hole. In addition to the golf course, the club boasts an extensive practice facility that includes a driving range with three target greens, chipping and putting greens, and a short game area.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1226,,,,,,

Undulating breaks make them difficult to read at times. The layout starts with a relatively open front nine where bunkered greens are the most prominent challenges. The back nine is longer and there are more trees and penalty ditches. The 16th hole is one of the most challenging on the golf course with a plateau green that sits four feet above the fairway and flanked with bunkers. The title of most difficult hole though, goes to Benvenue Country Club's fourth hole. There are out-of-bounds along the entire right side of the fairway on this hole and the narrow opening to the green is tightly bordered by three bunkers.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10208,,,,,,

The secluded locale is ideal for golf, especially since it is conveniently situated less than an hour from Charlotte. The course tumbles across lush green hills and valleys, providing almost every hole with an elevated tee or green. The undulating layout definitely plays like a mountain golf course with even lies being hard to find and a few blind shots to contend with. Water hazards come into play on seven holes, including the first three and the 12th hole, an uphill par 3 that is one of the golf course's most difficult. In addition to the course, Eagle Chase G.C. also offers a driving range, practice bunker, and chipping and putting greens.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1208,,,,,,

It's not just the water hazards that make this a tough course though. You'll be faced with strategically placed bunkers, sloped greens, and fairways tightly lined with trees. The golf course starts out gentle enough but by the time you get to the third hole, you'll be tested with a hole that plays right into the prevailing wind. This long narrow par 4 is one of the toughest holes Emerald Lake Golf Club has to offer. You'll get a brief break with the fourth hole, but the following par 5 is the signature hole. This risk-reward hole could result in a birdie if you play it smart, but if you go for the green in two and don't make it, you might be punished with a bogey",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10122,,,,,,

The final three are especially memorable water holes, playing over a series of marshes and lakes. The undulating greens follow the natural contours of the landscape and they are accented with pot bunkers to add some challenge. Dye also included his signature multi-level fairways.

The golf course features tight fairways lined with mature trees, tricky doglegs, and multi-tiered greens that can be difficult to read. The rolling terrain also promises difficult uphill and downhill lies. Bunkers are strategically placed throughout and there is water on a few holes. A windy day adds yet another formidable element to the challenging design. The diverse layout has a mix of difficult par 3s, reachable par 5s, and a few birdie opportunities.

Don’t let the 6,485 yards on the scorecard fool you, the daunting elevation changes make the course feel much longer. Walkers should be forewarned that this mountainous golf course is nearly impossible on foot. You can expect a few approaches to uphill greens but more often you’ll be faced with intimidating shots from elevated tees, which loom more than 200 feet above the severely contoured fairways below.

The front nine is gentler than the back, where the par 3s present formidable tests. The water hazards on the back are particularly challenging. The golf course finishes with one of its most memorable holes. Ravenwood's par-5 18th has a green that's tucked into the woods with the hill behind it forming a natural amphitheater.

The golf club bought the old Nashville Golf and Country Club's clubhouse and land for $22,500, leased an additional 92 acres on which to build an 18-hole golf course and enlisted the golf course architect Donald Ross to lay it all out.Of course, golfers at the Richland Country Club today are playing an all-new golf course in an all-new spot, this one a Jack Nicklaus Signature Golf Course that runs alongside the Granny White Park.After a round at the Richland Country Club, head back to the clubhouse and the Waxo Greene Grille for casual eats and sweet vistas of the golf course, not to mention a round around the fireplace.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12615,,,,,,

17900,Abernathy Country Club,"Like so many other small-town courses in the Panhandle, this “country club” is a 9-hole, semi-private course that allows anyone to play. With only one water hazard (hole 9), no bunkers, and flat terrain, this course is very fair, good for the ego, and fun for the high handicapper. This course is best experienced as a day trip from Lubbock.The fairways are lined with trees and sport rare mounds that result in an uneven lie. Both par 5s have dogleg fairways. The toughest hole is a 226-yard, par 3 into a green framed by mature trees; it’s particularly difficult when the winds are howling. Pay once and play all day. For the second round use the additional set of tees for a different look.Getting there : Exit FM 2060 off of I-27 and head east 4.5 miles to the course.",,,,,,,
17901,Abilene Country Club,"The par-70 Club Course at Abilene Country Club dates back to 1920, but was redesigned in 1993 by George Williams and Garrett Gill, who reconstructed 10 holes. Pro golfers such as Tommy Bolt, Charles Coody, Don Cherry, Mike Standly, and Bob Estes have all spent time here.The fairways are generous and the layout is loaded with bunkers. The track’s first hole of note is the beautiful 360-yard par 4 No. 5, which doglegs left. Locals aim at the three oaks on the right side of the fairway and work their draw. The most difficult hole is the 390-yard par 4 ninth hole, which plays uphill into the wind with an approach that must carry water. Hole 14 (190 yards) is also tough, requiring a long iron with the wind–which makes it impossible at times to hold the green, and is especially treacherous with water front and left of the green.Getting there : From I-20 west, exit 83/84 and take the Buffalo Gap exit.

William McConnell designed the course way back in 1919, and renovations occurred in 1960 (Warren Cantrell), and again in 1983 (Jay Morrish).Tree-lined fairways, various hills, and several out-of-bounds make this a tough course, even though it’s relatively short and there are minimal water hazards. The course has a good variety of holes, with several par 4s over 400 yards and only three par 5s. The feature hole is No. 6, a 349-yard par 4 that requires an approach shot over a lake into a green surrounded by bunkers.Getting there : North of town on I-40 going west, take the Western Ave. exit and turn left.

Its back nine is the favorite-a challenging, tighter track with a better set of holes. The best hole is No. 15, a long, 430-yarder that involves water off the tee and a creek that impacts the approach on the left.Getting there : From Houston, take I-45 north to Hwy. 105.

17916,Archer City Country Club,"Defining the outskirts of town, with ranchland beyond the mesquite-lined fairways, this 9-hole, semi-private course has unquestionable character. Rusted iron ladders have been placed on the barbed-wire fences surrounding the course, enabling one to track down shots that somehow don’t find the fairway. The asphalt cart paths are cracked, the tee boxes are baked hard, and the bald Bermuda fairways shine like a bowling alley from the abuse of the sun and wind, enabling even the most incapable golfer to reach a par 5 in two.The track features medium-length par 4s and a small lake that comes into play on a few holes. There are a few elevation changes, but the course is mostly flat. The greens are simple to read, a bit quick, and in good condition. Best of all, the price is right and the people are friendly.Getting there : From Wichita Falls, take Texas 79 south to Archer City.

The front nine allows more room for wild tee shots, as it’s more wide-open than the back. The feature hole is No. 13, a 427-yard par 4 highlighted by a blind approach shot to the green.Getting there : From I-20 drive east and take Hwy 19 south.

17922,Austin Country Club,"Back around 1900, when the greater Austin area was only home to about 25,000 residents, Harvard Law School graduate and lifetime Austinite Lewis Hancock organized one of Texas’ first formal country clubs, the venerable Austin Country Club.The first nine-hole course, now known as Hancock Park, featured sand greens and a tiny two-room framed clubhouse. The club stayed put for half a century, noted for the presence of Harvey Penick. Then after a huge local debate, the facility was moved to Riverside Drive in East Austin. From there it made it another 35 years before moving to its current Davenport Ranch location.The current ACC layout, designed by Pete Dye, rests on the shores of Lake Austin and the Colorado River. Dye didn’t veer from his usual method of creating an impressively difficult track using his trademark railroad ties, deep pot bunkers, and huge undulations.The opening holes play along Lake Austin, and are more of a links-style design. Afterwards the Hill Country takes effect, featuring canyons, ravines, creeks, and unbelievable views.The back nine features many outstanding holes, including the 446-yard No. 11, which deceptively doglegs left along a canyon before requiring an approach over that same deep ravine. The par 3 No. 16 also stands out, featuring a long carry over another canyon.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2747,,,,,,
17923,Austin Golf Club,"Ultra old-school, the Austin Golf Club is just that: a golf club. No real estate, no country club amenities, just a spectacular course designed by Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore. The course, which opened in 2001, has slipped under the publicity radar and is an exclusive, quiet club that simply serves as a place to play for its members.While not much information is available for the course, AGC is unique because of its outstanding caddie program, and because it’s one of the only courses in the area with Zoysia tees, fairways, and first cut of rough. Perhaps we’ll be able work our way on in the future, but for now we can only drool over the lush bent-greens that Master Crenshaw created.Getting there : We’re not exactly sure because the location is somewhat secret, but you could take Texas 71 west out of Austin for about 20 miles, then tour the back roads around Spicewood toward the lake looking for an ocean of green, lush Zoysia grass.",,,,,,,
17925,Balcones Country Club -Balcones,"Originally located in a remote part of the Hill Country that has now been absorbed by the Austin city limits, the BCC dates back to 1956 when it was only a 9-hole layout. Today the club boasts two totally distinct tracks, known as the Balcones Course and the Spicewood Course.The original 9-holer transformed into the easier Balcones Course. With water on only two holes (15 and 16), it’s just a friendlier layout that is enjoyable also because it plays fast. The signature hole is No. 6, a 456-yard par 4 highlighted by a magnificent old oak tree in the fairway.Getting there : From I-35 north, take Highway 183 north and take a right on Hunter's Chase Road. Turn left, drive a little ways, and the course is on your left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2748,,,,,,
17926,Ballinger Country Club,"This 9-hole, semi-private course (open to out-of-towners) features a small creek and mildly undulating terrain. The creek impacts two holes, and there is only one hole with bunkers. No. 2 is the signature hole, a 379-yard par 4 with a tee shot over a canyon and out-of-bounds on either side of the fairway. Nothing too fancy here–both par 3s are well under 200 yards. The first hole is a 268-yard par 4, and No. 3 is listed as a par 5 at 426 yards.Getting there : From the courthouse in town, turn left on Hwy 158. Follow the road as it veers left over a hill. You’ll see a nursing home hospital, and then eventually a green sign on the left for the city lake and country club. Take that road through one stop sign, then another four-way stop, then follow the main road 45 degrees due west to the course",,,,,,,
17929,Barton Creek Resort -Fazio Canyons,"The newest addition to the Barton Creek golf mecca is known as The Canyons, a tipped out 7,153 yard, par-72 Tom Fazio masterpiece that is actually two miles from the resort’s clubhouse. Environmentally friendly like the other three tracks, this one was designated in the Certified Audubon Sanctuary System (one of the first in the country), which speaks to the level of care that went into preserving the natural environment.At Fazio’s disposal was the Short Springs Branch Creek, a scenic limestone bedded feature that rolls through the course, and enhances the oak and sycamore laden fairways. The views on this one are just as tremendous as the others, and the golf community has already heaped heavy praise for the Canyons, with Golfweek Magazine labeling it the #1 Course in Texas for 2002.The ender is the signature, a 561-yarder that might be the best finishing hole at Barton Creek. The most difficult hole finishes off the front side, a 457-yard par 4.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/22400,,,,,,
17932,Bay City Country Club,"Bay City's original course dates back to the 1930s-it lays out along the Colorado River with giant old oak trees lining the fairways. In addition to the river, another creek winds through the layout, keeping water in play on just about every hole.No. 6 is considered the signature not only for the stunning view of the countryside, but for its 185-yard poke over the water. The ender is tough as well, featuring trees along the left, the river on the right, and that pesky creek that fronts the green.Other notes: A tenth hole was added after the river temporarily swallowed No. 8. Walking is only allowed during the week.Getting there : From Hwy. 35, turn left on Latuelley, and the course is about a mile away.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2760,,,,,,
17934,Bay Oaks Country Club,"Bay Oaks CC features a challenging Arthur Hills design that lays out along Horsepen Bayou, offering a good combination of traditional and links-style holes. Man-made lakes and the bayou bring water into play on 14 of 18 holesThe more traditional front nine is highlighted by the 531-yard No. 5, which bends right around a lake that comes into play on every shot.The more open back nine features more notable holes, including the best par 3, a 184-yard No. 12 over water, and two outstanding finishing holes. No. 17 doglegs right 435 yards to a green that is bordered by water on the right, and No. 18 plays 450 yards over a swale to a green bordered by water on the left.From the tips, the par 4s are long, ranging from 429 to 459 yards, and every par 5 is over 500 yards, including the 569-yard No. 16 .Getting there : From Houston, take I-45 to the Clear Lake exit and turn left.

17942,Beaumont Country Club,"Alex Findlay laid the BCC out in 1906, making it one of the oldest clubs in the state. He created what is now a short, old-school layout with narrow, tree-lined fairways and small, immaculately conditioned greens.Findlay opens the course with some of the easiest holes of the 18, including the 291-yard par 4 No. 1. Another short par 4 and two par 3s follow, allowing the day to start right. Later on the front, the number one handicap 8th hole shows up, playing 520 yards and generally not reachable in two.The back nine consists of short par 4s and 3s and offers plenty of birdie opportunities.Getting there : From I-10 east, take Hwy. 69 north to Lucas, then drive east to Pine St. Turn left and the course is a short distance down the road.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2767,,,,,,

No need to bring your sand wedge, as there are no bunkers, but water comes into play on many holes.The 509-yard par 5 No. 2 hole features a tee shot into a dogleg-right fairway and an approach that must carry the pond fronting the green. Water also protects the front of the greens on holes 5, 7 and 8. Another notable hole is No. 3, a 229-yard par 3.Getting there : Located off the Hwy. 181bypass just outside Beeville.",,,,,,,
17946,Bellville Golf & Recreation Club,"Bellville offers a decent little 9-hole country course with wide-open fairways and small, mound-shaped greens that can be extremely tricky at times, depending on the condition. As with many small-town courses, the funds just are not available to maintain the course up to championship standards, so conditions vary depending on the weather. The trick here is to get used to the target greens and deal with the conditions-otherwise you might miss a few make-able putts. But we do that under the best of conditions, so does it really matter?One pond comes into play on holes 6 and 7. Despite the greens, the tee boxes and fairways are generally in good condition.Getting there : From I-10 east, take Hwy. 36 north to the course about 15 miles away",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2774,,,,,,

17950,Bent Tree Country Club,"Located next to Dallas’ exclusive Preston Trail Golf Club, Bent Tree opened in 1974 as the centerpiece for a 700-acre development headed by Dallas real estate investors Robert Folsom and John Murchison. The two hired the eclectic Scotsman Desmond Muirhead to design the course on 190 acres of former cotton fields.In the 1980s, the LPGA and Senior PGA tours frequently hosted tournaments at Bent Tree, and the course was eventually renovated in 1990. The improvements focused on the front nine (which is still more open than the back), spicing up the layout with bunkering, tree additions, and adjustments to greens.Water comes into play on 14 of 18 holes, and the course is quite long if you play from the tips. The best hole on the front is No. 3, a long par 5 that plays almost 600 yards. The narrow fairway chutes between water on the left and bunkers on the right, and the small green slopes severely to the water on the left side.The more interesting back nine offers a nice stretch of golf on holes 13-15. No. 14 is the most scenic on the course because it plays downhill at least 75 feet to a green surrounded on three sides by water. The 387-yard 18th is the perfect finishing hole–not too long but plenty challenging.Getting there : From I-635 east, take the Dallas North Tollway and exit Westgrove. The course is on the left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2861,,,,,,
17951,Bentwater Yacht & Country Club -Miller,"The Miller Course is quite different from Weiskopf's design. Architect Jack Miller, who worked as a designer under Jack Nicklaus for 10 years, bragged that the terrain ""is absolutely the finest piece of land I've ever been able to work on."" His parkland-style track features lush fairways, virtually no rough, pine needles sprinkled about the course, and Champion Bermuda greens that are surrounded by huge swales.No. 14 is bordered by the blue waters of Lake Conroe, and is annually selected as one of the best par 3s in Texas",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3180,,,,,,
17952,Bentwood Country Club,"Bentwood opened in 1979 and is an 18-hole private course laid out through a residential community. The course can be difficult when the wind is blowing, especially with its somewhat lengthy layout (almost 7,000 yards from the tips) and out-of-bounds on most holes. Four sets of tees provide options for every skill level. The fairways and roughs consist of the durable 419 Bermuda grass, and the large, undulating greens are Champion Dwarf Bermuda.The front nine gives you the chance to start well with several par 4s under 400 hundred yards, and a 523 yard par 5 that is a definite birdie opportunity when the wind is at your back.The feature hole is No. 8, which has out-of-bounds on the right and usually plays into the prevailing south wind. At 464 yards it plays more like a par 5, and starts a difficult stretch of golf that extends through the 13th hole. Holes 9 and 10 play just over 400 yards, with the latter a dogleg left with water on the right and out-of-bounds on the left. The approach on No. 10 is into an elevated green surrounded by bunkers. Eleven is a 517-yard par 5, followed by a monster par 3 (224 yards), and another relatively long par 4 No. 13 (420 yards).Getting there : Located on the southwest side of town off Loop 306.

17954,Berry Creek Country Club,"Named after the creek that runs through the layout, this is an outstanding course with some of the state’s premier holes.A limestone quarry is incorporated into the design, which provides a spectacular backdrop to the tee shot over water on the 175-yard No. 8.The front nine is more open than the tree-lined back, but both sides feature tight fairways. Water is in play on 10 holes, including the tricky 326-yard 9th, where the tee shot needs to clear the first lake and the approach must carry another.The par 3 No. 12 is another beautiful hole. Your tee shot must slide through a narrow chute of trees and avoid the lake to the left of the skinny green.Getting there : From I-35 north, take Exit 266 and turn left. When you come to Berry Creek Drive, turn left again and drive 1.5 miles to the course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2948,,,,,,

17956,Big Spring Country Club,"Big Spring's country club is an 18-hole private course that dates back to the early 1960s. Its design features open fairways that are flat and easy to walk, and offer the chance to shoot a career-low round. Water hazards are not predominant but do come into play on a few holes. The greens are considered fast, and as always out here, wind can be an issue when it's howling 20-30 mph.Getting there : The course is located south of town of US 87.

17960,Blue Lake Golf Club,"Often overshadowed by the high-dollar resorts and new championship layouts, Blue Lake is one of the lesser-known gems of the Highland Lake area. Exuding the old-school charm of its course designer, the crusty Jimmy Burke, this scenic track is loaded with wildlife and is generally a joy to play because of its simplicity.Burke’s par 32 layout consists of five par 3s, three par 4s, and only one par 5. There are no bunkers or water hazards. The course weaves in and out of a quaint housing community, and a few elevated tees offer views of Lake LBJ.Notable holes include the 365-yard par 4 with out-of-bounds looming left and trees on the right, and the par 3 16th, which plays almost 200 yards.Two sets of tees make for an 18-hole round, andyou can pay once and play all day.Getting there : From Hwy. 71 west, turn right on Blue Lake Deer Haven Dr., then drive 2 miles north to the course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3135,,,,,,

It is a 3086 yard 9-hole, semi-private facility that features wide-open fairways, minimal trees, small greens, and a creek that is incorporated into the design. In fact, water impacts play on five of the nine holes. The layout also incorporates a few dogleg fairways that make strategy a little more important here than on other small-town courses. Come play golf, swim, play tennis or toss horse shoes. New memberships and walk-ins welcomed.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2999,,,,,,
17965,Bonham Golf & Country Club,"Bonham’s country club lays out around a creek that meanders through the course and comes into play as the primary obstacle on 8 out of 9 holes. The short course, void of bunkers, opens up with a nice, short par 3 that only requires a 9 iron at most. The remainder of the layout features short par 4s, and a series of back-to-back par 5s and par 3s on holes 4-8.The toughest hole, which is the longest par 4, is the 395-yard No. 3, but it’s followed by a 278-yard par 4.Two sets of tees allow for an 18-hole round.Getting there : From Loop 121 north, turn right on Russell Ave. From Hwy.78, turn left on Russell Ave.",,,,,,,
17966,Booker Country Club,"Unique in that it is the northernmost course in Texas, BCC is a nice little layout with a few trees lining wide fairways. The greens here are rarely guarded by anything other than the occasional bunker, so the design incorporates elevated greens with subtle sloping to cause problems. Hole 4 is the feature hole: a 382-yard par 4 with out-of-bounds staked by a barbed wire fence on the left and trees on the right.Getting there : From Booker, take Hwy 15 to Main St. and drive north for 1 block.

Situated 50 miles west of Waco, this quaint, casual course rests along the Bosque River and features mature oak trees lining its narrow fairways. The greens are small, of average speed, and putt true.This 3,054-yard par 35 does not require length, but accuracy is important because of the overhanging trees. Water impacts play on two of the final three holes, and while the course starts out fairly wide open, you’ll soon learn to be aware of the impact of the trees.Getting there : From I-35, take Hwy. 22 west to Meridian.

The course features wide, tree-lined fairways and small greens, as well as water that comes into play on almost half of the holes.One local told us that short-iron play was important; however, that’s hard to imagine considering the length of some of the holes. Three holes stand out from the tips: Two par 5s play 600 yards or better (No. 11 is 643 yards), and No. 3, a 247-yard par 3. The rest of the layout is of a more reasonable length, particularly from the middle tees, where there are a few short par 5s under 500 yards as well as par 4s around the 300-yard range.Getting there : From Houston, take Hwy. 290 west and turn right on FM 577.

The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas.

Fred Mcleaod, then the winter professional at Maryland's Columbia Country Club, built the course in 1909, followed by a redesign at the hands of John Bredemus in 1921 and a rare visit by Robert Trent Jones in the mid-1960s. This beautiful links-style course offers open fairways and undulating greens where stiff winds can interfere with drives and cause high shots to blow wildly off course.When the 9-hole course originally opened on the high-toned North Beach, President William Howard Taft was in Texas to visit his brother, who owned a ranch across Nueces Bay. Taft participated in the opening ceremonies in front of the green wooden building which is distinguished by its white trim and veranda on all four sides.The course fell victim to the 1919 hurricane, and club members didn't reorganize until 1921. John Bredemus came down from Del Rio after the completion of the San Felipe Springs Country Club and immediately put crewmen to work clearing and grading for $1.50 a day. The fairways and greens were fertilized with cottonseed meal, and the first shot was fired on Labor Day, 1922. At the time, this course on the Texas Riviera was considered one of the finest in the country.At the end of the Depression, oil was discovered under the course and wells produced from 1936 to 1943, increasing revenues but creating some interesting man-made hazards in the layout. By 1938, the club expanded the course to 18 holes.

Native hardwood and dogwood trees line the fairways, and most tee shots will require a blast through a narrow tunnel out into a wide landing area.The layout features dogleg fairways that result in tricky approach shots into huge greens (averaging over 8,400 square feet) that are protected by grass and sand bunkers, and very often water hazards. Both the front and back nines feature an island green–one of which is the signature par 3 No. 6, which plays 210 yards downhill into a green protected on all sides by water.Getting there : Out of Noonday, TX, drive about 3 miles to Texas 187 and look for the Eagle’s Bluff sign on the right side of the road.

The main problem for golfers on this 3,235-yard track is the wind, since the course is fairly open and not protected by trees. The greens are rather large with subtle undulations, and like the rest of the course, are in excellent condition. This is also one where you can pay once and play all day.Getting there : From Houston, take Hwy. 59 south for 75 miles to Hwy. 71.

18118,El Paso Country Club,"The crown jewel of golf out here is the El Paso Country Club, with its old-school charm and a burgeoning reputation as a proving ground for future PGA stars. Built along the Rio Grande River, this course is the oldest in West Texas, dating back to 1906. It has gained recent acclaim since former employee Rich Beem burst onto the scene with his victory at the 2002 PGA Championship. The colorful tales of the Friday game at EPCC paint a vivid picture of how the former cell phone salesman honed his gamesmanship and confidence to the level of a major champion.The present course was designed in 1922 by Jack Harden, then modified via a $1.5 million Ron Fream renovation. The traditional layout is not long (6,889 yards), but requires pro-like accuracy on approach shots, and the bent-grass greens feature the speed and quickness characteristic of any pro setup.No. 15 is the feature hole. It's a short par 4 that requires accuracy to avoid the fairway bunkers and trees off the tee, then a little savvy to deal with the approach shot into a super-slick green covered by more bunkers.Getting there : From I-10 west take Exit 11 and make a left turn onto Mesa. Drive over the railroad tracks, then turn left onto Country Club, which will lead you directly to the course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2897,,,,,,

18129,Fairway Oaks Country Club,"Originally built in the 1970s by Ron Garl and Charles Coody, the club was purchased in the late 1990s and has been updated for the more modern game. Fairway is a long, challenging course that has hosted the Southwest Classic from 1981 to 1991. The layout incorporates many bunkers, and water dominates the back nine. In 1981 the LaJet Classic at Fairway Golf and Racquet Club was added to the PGA tour.The highlight of the course is the demanding nature of the finishing holes. Many a promising round has been tossed into the water that’s present on each of the last five finishing holes. Survive the carries on 14 and 15, and deal with the par 3 hole 16 with water on the left, and your confidence will be strong enough to deal with the 448-yard par 4 17th, which requires a tee shot of at least 200 yards to reach the fairway. From the blue tees the par 5 18th is only 485 yards, but the lake runs the entire length of the fairway waiting to eat any fade or slice.Getting there : From Hwy 83/84, exit Antilley Rd. and turn right.

The signature of this course is the large, undulating greens that are kept in perfect condition. The fairways are wide open and are lined by trees and a standard cut of rough. Although there are no sand bunkers, grass bunkers are scattered throughout and a lake comes into play on two holes. Two sets of tees make for an 18-hole round, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how differently the course plays on that second nine.Getting there : From Lubbock take Hwy. 84 west to Farwell.

The signature hole, the par-3 seventh, features a green that is surrounded by water on three sides and a spectacular view of the mountains. Flying L Guest Ranch Golf Course & Resort's back nine is less challenging than the front nine, but it has a few interesting surprises in store.

18139,Fort Clark Springs Golf Club,"Fort Clark Springs is a residential and resort community that offers a short 18-hole regulation course and a 9-hole par 3 course, both of which are open for public play. Las Moras Creek meanders through the picturesque community of about 750 households, and the population swells a bit during the winter as retirees move in and take advantage of the warm weather.One of the great features of this course is that it offers the chance to play from the tips and score very well, as the back tees are just over 5,700 yards. Most of the par 4s are barely over 300 yards, making length off the tee a non-issue. Only the par 4 No. 16 at 357 yards resembles anything close to what you might see back home. Hole 12 has some length at 566 yards, and is the number one handicap hole.Plan accordingly if you're in the area, as the course is very popular with the locals and can get very crowded. Call ahead. Tee times are required on the weekends. One option is to get there early and walk on the par 3 course as a warm-up for your round on the big course.Getting there : The course is on Hwy. 90 on the north side of the road.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2787,,,,,,

The Salado del Rio course is the more scenic of the two, offering spectacular views of the rustic countryside. The historic facility boasts some famous players including Sam Snead and Arnold Palmer. The layout is also more difficult than the other championship course at the club due to the presence of numerous blind shots and water hazards. Both Fort Sam Houstan golf courses feature tight, tree-lined fairways and greens that are medium in both size and speed.

18151,Gaines County Golf Course,"After you drive through this flat, barren region of cotton and oil production, you’ll be stunned when you stumble upon this hidden Panhandle gem that played host to Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer in a 1963 exhibition. Originally built as a 9-hole course by Jim Terry in 1953, the facility was updated with another nine holes in 1991.The layout features good elevation and plenty of trees, especially considering the terrain. The most outstanding amenity is the greens, which are large, fast, and in excellent condition. Sometimes the fairways dry out and the condition is average, but that helps the ball roll and is definitely beneficial when the wind is blowing.Every par 3 requires a long iron, but the demanding par 4s are the attention-getters. Two par 4s stand out among many that are above average in difficulty for courses in this remote area. The signature hole is No. 8: it’s only 340 yards but requires an approach shot over a pond to a well-bunkered green. Hole 5 also plays tough as a 435-yard dogleg right with an approach into an elevated green. This hole is particularly long into the wind.Getting there : Drive through Seminole north on Hwy. 385 and look for the signs to the course. The course is set in a large grove of trees on the left side of the highway.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3318,,,,,,
18153,Galveston Country Club,"The original Galveston CC dates back to 1898 as a 9-hole track with a membership of only 30; however, the hurricane of 1900 wiped out the facility. The club moved back and forth between the island and the mainland in the early 1900s-it was once known as the Oleander Country Club around 1912 before moving back onto the beach in 1918. That location on 61st Street remained intact until 1946, when John Bredemus was asked to design the new, short, water-infested, wind-burdened layout that exists today.Ralph Plummer and Carlton Gipson had their hands in things over the years as developer George Mitchell obtained the facility's lease in exchange for promised long-term improvements.Today mature palms and oleanders line the fairways, and much like the old days, the modern version is known for precise shot-making. Solid course management is mandatory for scoring well.No. 7 is the most difficult, a 418-yarder that's lined by water on the left for the first half of the hole. Bogey is a good score when the wind is blowing. On the back side, the 180-yard No. 11 is a real treat. Virtually surrounded by water, the hole plays over the edge of the lake into a green framed by bunkers with water in the back.Getting there : From I-45 south, take the 61st St. exit, then drive to Sea Wall Blvd. Turn right and head down to 12 Mile Rd.

18157,Garden Valley Golf Resort -Dogwood,"The older Hummingbird Course, which has taken a back seat to the now-famous Dogwood Course, still offered some adequate golf even though the quality was not up to the standards of its more popular brethren. Highlighted by extreme elevation changes, the course’s signature hole was the 566-yard No. 2, which required two shots over a hill followed by a tricky approach back downhill to the green. Hummingbird course was closed recently and only the newer Dogwood course can be played.In 1992 John Sanford was blessed with some amazing terrain for the Dogwood Course addition. Cut out of the thick East Texas forest with 100-foot-plus tall pines, this course is most often compared to the famed Augusta National because of the abundant crape myrtle, Carolina jasmine, hollies, and dogwoods–not to mention the more than 1,500 azaleas that bloom beautifully in the spring.Although there are only two par 4s over 400 yards, the Dogwood is plenty difficult, playing to a 132 slope rating. Water is in play on 12 holes, the elevation changes are extremely confusing, and the bent-grass greens are lightning-fast.The regulars know that a good start is imperative because the first four holes are the easiest on the course–two short par 4s and two easy par 3s over water. You’ll need that momentum as the holes grow increasingly more difficult.The par 3 9th hole plays 212 yards with an intimidating body of water lurking left. Hole 11 features a lake to the left and behind the green. No. 13 is the most difficult, featuring a testy drive through the chute of trees off the tee and a massive lake that protects the green.Getting there : From I-20, take Hwy. 110 (Exit 548) south.

The second nine was added in the 1970s, and today the par 70 layout rolls through the San Gabriel River valley, with water coming into play on eleven holes.The old nine is more basic, taking advantage of the natural terrain without as many modern, man-made hazards. The newer back is a bit more difficult, highlighted by the signature 13th, which plays 538-yards and crosses the San Gabriel twice.Getting there : From I-35 north, take the Lake Georgetown/Andice exit and turn left.

Lakes are placed throughout the design, coming into play on 13 holes, and the greens are extremely fast with sneaky undulations. The main trick to playing Golfcrest is dealing with the wind.Other notes: In 1932, Golfcrest experimented with night golf by installing floodlights on the front nine.Getting there : From Hwy. 288 south take Hwy. 18 east to Country Club Dr. Turn left, drive 1 mile to the course, and look for the entrance on the right side of the street.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3228,,,,,,

The number one handicap is hole 2, a 380-yard par 4. As always, pay them once and play till golf until you can’t play anymore.Getting there : From Lubbock, take Hwy. 82 east to Lorenzo.

Originally built as a golf, hunting, and fishing club, the course is laid out in uniquely beautiful terrain for this part of Texas. This rolling course, primarily designed by Warren Cantrell, is loaded with mature trees and is difficult because of the wind and the multitude of long par 4s.Nos. 1, 4, and 9 stand out on the front. The opener is a 534-yard par 5 with out-of-bounds on the right. No. 4 doglegs left and is tricky because of out-of-bounds on the right. Hole 9 is the layout’s signature hole–playing along an old creek bed with a large cottonwood jutting into the fairway, this 430-yard hole requires accuracy of the tee and a long approach into a well-bunkered green.On the back, No. 11 is tough because of its length (543 yards). This hole doglegs right and has out-of-bounds on the left. No. 15 can get you at 395 yards, doglegging left around the lake.1950s. Warren Cantrell. 18 holes. Gold – 6,911 (72.9/127).

For now this course, which opened in the late 1970s, may have to wait a few more decades for its legend to grow. The course is certainly worthy, offering immaculate conditions paired with demanding target golf. Water is in play on 13 holes, the pine-lined fairways feature numerous elevation changes, and the greens are small targets.The best hole on the front is No. 4, about a 180-yarder all over water, but you're bound to notice the opening set of holes that feature two monster par 5s. The 583-yard No. 3 bends left around a lake and plays to a tricky little green nestled against water's edge.On the back, you'll remember the ender-an almost 600-yard tree-lined monster. And the preceding 203-yard No. 17 isn't the way to build confidence for the finisher.

Tee shots that fail to cut the corner perfectly leave a monstrous approach into the green.Other notes: Celebrities such as Mickey Mantle, Y.A. Tittle, and Roy Clark have graced the fairways here.

And now with the recent completion of a massive irrigation project, the course is in the best condition of its 55-year existence.The design features plush fairways lined by oak trees, and small, elevated greens. Because of the tight fairways, locals are in the habit of using irons off the tee. The feature hole is No. 7, a 400-yard par 4 with an approach shot over water.

You should: it's a good course with great bent-grass greens, and the conditions would be a lot better if they ever had any rain out here. Take your lip balm, because the wind will be blowing. You'll probably want to leave your camera behind because there's nothing really too picturesque about this golf course. The tees are slightly elevated and there is no water. The bent-grass greens are in unbelievable condition given the circumstances. There are two sets of tees for an 18-hole round.The No. 1 tee box sits directly in front of the clubhouse and is shaded by a large tree and a pavilion. The opening shot is over the road that leads to the clubhouse.The scene here is surreal. Ancient golf carts from the 1960s are littered with Crown Royal bottles, empty beer cans, cigarettes, haggard, well-used clubs with worn grips, and other random paraphernalia.

The approach must carry the bunker fronting the green.The back nine features two mean par 5s–Nos. 11 and 15. The 11th is a narrow dogleg with a small pond looming right of the green. No. 15 is under 500 yards but features the creek cutting the fairway and riding the right side of the hole.Other notes: The clubhouse burned to the ground in November of 1996 and was replaced in 1998.Getting there : From I-75 north, take the Eldorado Pkwy/Exit 39 and go west.

The golf course is interwoven with a meandering creek that is connected to three ponds, all of which come into play on several holes throughout the course. The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is.

18356,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur.

All three courses were built on a rolling terrain with mature creeks sprinkled throughout and meandering creeks running through, which can all affect shots. The Blue Course is the shortest of the three courses but Blue plays long due to the elevated greens. The creeks create water hazards that come into play on several holes and there are also many strategically placed sand bunkers throughout the course as well.

This monster doglegs left inside a cliff that runs along the right side. Out-of-bounds is left, and a fairway bunker resides about a lob wedge from the narrow green, which is bolstered from behind by more bunkers.No. 18 is one of the more interesting finishing holes that you’ll come across, featuring two dogleg fairways, one right and one left, that both involve dealing with the creek that splits the two routes. The tee shot right is more favorable, since it is void of fairway bunkers like the ones on the left side.

The tight course is an interesting mix of par 3s and par 4s with some par 5s thrown in as well.

18411,Odessa Country Club,"John Bredemus built this course in the late 1930s, and his design makes the most of the flat West Texas terrain. This is an old-school golf course with tree-lined fairways and undulating bent-grass greens. The fairways are wide and the course is a fair test of golf. When the wind blows the course can play difficult, but with only a smattering of water hazards, it's not too tough.The signature hole is the 215-yard par 3 No. 9. The long shot into the shallow green is challenging, and the swale in the green makes it hard to hold. Other feature holes here are the 560-yard No. 7 that seems to always play into the wind. Off the tee you'll see water right and out-of-bounds left, with a narrow landing area. On the back 9, hole 14 is a 430-yard par 4 with another tee shot into a tight landing area, which generally leaves a long approach into an elevated green.Getting there : Located east of town.

Out-of-bounds squeezes the narrow fairways on most holes on the front nine as it winds through a residential community. Then water becomes the predominant hazard on the back, impacting almost every hole. Your approaches will find fast, undulating bent-grass greens.The design features two challenging par 5s: The 549-yard No. 5 plays uphill into the prevailing wind, and No. 12 plays almost 600 yards with a tee shot through a chute of trees, and two more shots over water, including the approach into a green that is surrounded by the wet stuff. Another tough hole is No. 14, a 225-yard par 3 that requires a solid shot to carry the water.Getting there : From I-27 south, exit Hunsley and go west.

Because of the creeks and ponds scattered throughout the course, you’ll score higher than your normal handicap until you learn the layout.Beware of the back nine. Hole 14 is the most difficult, at 423 yards with out-of-bounds and water along the left side of the fairway and behind the green. No. 15 plays tough also, with a fairway framed by out-of-bounds on the right and water on the left, and an approach into a long, narrow green.

Cut out of a 3,000-acre former commercial pecan orchard in the floodplain of the Brazos River, Howard did his best to preserve trees and create a unique layout with good holes. His best work here is reflected in the difficult par 3s, all requiring long irons when playing from the 6,800-yard-plus tips.Getting there : From Hwy. 377 west, take Hwy. 144 south to Granbury.

18448,Pedernales Country Club,"“Willie’s Course” is officially called the Pedernales Country Club, but “Cut ‘N Putt” is also printed on the scorecard. This rugged, almost pasture-golf-like course is known for its superb greens, goes 3,330 yards, and despite its lack of formal hazards, is extremely challenging unless you’ve played it a few times.The old sand bunkers have been covered by sprawling Bermuda. The fairways are hard–sometimes solid tee shots will roll and roll until they find the Hill Country scrub that lines the fairways.Holes 4 and 7 have water. The fourth is notable because it requires a perfectly placed mid-iron into the dogleg-left fairway with water on the left, followed by an uphill approach over the drink to the green. They call the 7th hole the signature: the elevated tee offers one of the course’s best views, and you’ll have to deal with a severely sloping fairway that cuts right and requires another perfect tee shot to avoid having your ball slip off into oblivion.Suffice it to say, this is required golf for any true Texan who dabbles in the great game. It’s Willie’s course and it’s public. You can choose to play by his “cowboy-Zen” rules and save yourself a few strokes. Heck, he might even join you if he’s on the premises.Other notes: Charles Howard built the course and Willie took it over in 1979. Don’t miss the clubhouse, which is just a small building with Willie paraphernalia littering the walls.Getting there : From Austin, take Hwy. 71 west and turn right on County Road 2322.

There is mature landscaping throughout that sets its apart from younger courses. The mostly flat terrain of the course provides an enjoyable walk. The layout features bent grass greens and player-friendly fairways. There are a few water hazards that come into play as well as the occasional bunker, but overall the course is gentle enough for beginners to approach it with confidence. For more advanced players, it is excellent practice, especially for the price.

No. 3 is a picturesque par 3, playing 170 yards downhill, with a green framed by the red bluffs. On no. 6, keep the tee shot right to avoid a blind second shot, and watch out for the tough, two-tiered green. The seventh hole plays along the Colorado, and is protected by a massive cottonwood tree on the left. On the back, make note that the highest point on the course is the 11th green. For the home stretch, make the most of the two downhill par 3s. No. 12 plays 180 yards and you'll need to leave it below the hole.

18471,Preston Trail Golf Club,"What makes this one of the best golf courses in the state? Let’s list the reasons: Location: Far north Dallas, with White Rock Creek meandering through. Layout: Stunning and traditional, with tree-lined fairways, the right amount of water and bunkering, and huge, lightning-fast bent-grass greens. Feel: Cart paths run the way they should--from greens to tees, not the other way around. And caddies are always available to promote playing the game on foot. Mystique: Memorabilia of professional tour players who are also members is tastefully distributed throughout the clubhouse, and the shrine to Mickey Mantle (a longtime member) is awe-inspiring. You’ll need serious connections to play this course, but here are some highlights.The third hole is a 591-yard par 5 with a narrow tee shot that opens to a wide landing area. The homes lining the right side of the fairway no doubt shelter some of the most jealous people in the world. The second shot begins to run down the dramatic slope that ends in a huge green in front of the creek.The next par 5, the 498 yard 6th, has a similar slope which begins in the landing area of your drive. If you really pop it and have the wind, you’ll be at the base of the hill with about 175 yards left to the large, two-tiered green. Be careful, though–it’s protected by dense woods on the left and back, and water on the front and right.The 7th hole is the number one handicap. This 422-yard par 4 dogleg right requires a perfectly faded and long tee shot to get far enough into the throat to approach. You’ll still be hitting a long iron or wood into the severely back-to-front sloped green, and good luck making the putt from above the hole.The back nine is maybe the best anywhere, but two holes stand out above the rest. The 16th is a 428-yard par 4 with a slight dogleg left. The tee shot is elevated at least 100 yards above where the green sits. A big, high draw will put you about 150 yards away from the two-tiered green, which is protected by the creek in front. They really like to put the pin on the lower tier right in front of the creek, which gives you about 20 square yards to work with. It’s a lay-up hole for all but the longest and bravest.The 422-yard dogleg-right finishing hole is almost a mirror of the 16th–it’s a long dogleg right, all uphill. The tee area is extremely narrow from the tips, and the fairway slopes to the left to make shaving the corner as hard as possible. This ends up being a 5 par for most, and the outcome of many Nassaus is changed on this hole.It’s hard to describe this course without gushing, not to mention that hearing about it just frustrates most people because they won’t have a chance to see it for themselves. But keep your eyes and ears open for friends who may be members and schmooze them as much as possible–it will surely be worth the effort.The details : 972-380-0669. 17201 Preston Trail Dr., Dallas, TX 752481965.

There are two defining characteristics on this course, the trees and the doglegs. Every hole on the front nine is a dogleg with the exception of two of the par 3s. On the back nine, the doglegs are less frequent but that is where all of the mature trees come into play. There are also more dramatic changes in elevation on the back nine.

Built circa 1950, the flat, traditional layout plays to a par 70 and has water on nine holes.Notable holes on the front include the 604-yard opening hole, and No. 6, a 444-yard par 4. The back 9 features only one par 5, which plays only 487 yards, and several par 4s that play well under 400 yards. However, those are well balanced with two mean par 3s that require long irons (or even a 3-wood) and the difficult finishing hole: a 400-yard-plus par 4.Getting there : Exit Business 80 off of I-20 and drive north on Fairgrounds Rd.

18484,Rancho Viejo Resort & Country Club -El Diablo,"When Dennis Arp sculpted the El Diablo course out of the vast citrus orchards, golf became the thing to do in Rancho Viejo. This full-service resort boasts two excellent 18-hole courses of championship quality that have played host to the PGA Tour Qualifying School for Curtis Strange, Craig Stadler, and Peter Jacobson, as well as the likes of Willie Nelson and Dean Martin who have participated in the club's annual Hacker's Tournament.El Diablo (the devil) is the most demanding of the two layouts and earns its name with a design that features water on nine holes, ten dogleg holes, and large, undulating greens that are easy three-putts. Palm trees and tropical vegetation provide problems and out-of-bounds is always a factor, since the course sometimes routes between houses.Hole 3 is one of the most difficult, a 440-yard dogleg left with water affecting both the drive and the approach. No. 14 is a long par 5 that doglegs twice around a lake, and the par 3 No. 16 plays 224 yards from the tips. The tee shot on 16 carries 120 yards of what was once part of the Rio Grande River. The large green is protected by bunkers, but is difficult to hit because of the wind.

Two par 5s stand out on the Old Course. No. 2 plays a whopping 618 yards, and the 18th goes 511 yards with water all along the right side and four bunkers protecting the green. This final hole marks the end of an extremely tough finish to the course, since water is in play on the final five holes.The New Course opened seven years later to accommodate the demand created by new residents. Known as a shot-maker's track, the design features heavy bunkering, impressive lakes, and demanding, elevated greens. This course has as much or more water than its older brother.You'll need precision tee shots during the round, especially on the 331-yard No. 16-it plays into a dogleg-left fairway and features an approach over a huge bunker in front of the green.Other notes: Raveneaux is the name of the place where Napoleon took time to relax.

Jay Morrish renovated the course in 1988. Hole 2 is guarded on the left by the Trinity River and is long at 450 yards. Number 10 is loaded with hazards–a lake guards the landing area that runs all the way to the back of the green. Drive it well on number 12, where the river weaves across the fairway three times. The landing area off the tee is in a very small area at the corner of the dogleg. The Trinity affects 14 as well, winding across the fairway in front of the tee and again at 225 yards out.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2926,,,,,,
18501,River Bend Resort & Country Club,"Set along the Rio Grande River, this is a scenic course with spectacular views. The front nine was built in 1987, and the back nine followed in 1992. The highlight of the course is what is perhaps the longest water hazard in Texas, the Rio Grande River, which flows along holes 5 through 13 on the left side of the fairway.Narrow fairways and grass bunkers make the course tough, especially when the wind is howling, as it is tough to hit the small, firm greens. Water is everywhere. No. 14 is the only hole without water. The par 3 17th hole, with its island greens, headlines a series of demanding par 3 holes. The last hole plays 434 yards into the wind and has out-of-bounds on either side of the fairway.Getting there : From Harlingen take Hwy. 77 south. When you come to Hwy. 802 turn right, then continue until you reach Hwy 281. Turn right again and drive approximately 2.5 miles to the course",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2794,,,,,,

Laid out along the Nueces River, River Hills is a short course with water hazards coming into play on almost half the holes. The design features narrow fairways and average-sized greens of medium speed.The 382-yard par 4 No. 2 is listed as the most difficult, but the next two most difficult rated holes also await you on the front nine. If you can survive the front, the back nine features a few short par 4s and two par 3s that require no more than a wedge or 9 iron.Getting there : From I-37 south take I-77 south and exit FM 624.

18504,River Oaks Country Club,"River Oaks isn't the oldest, but it's definitely one of the preeminent names in Houston golf. Dating back to 1925 when Houston was hardly exposed to the game of golf, Philadelphian Jack Burke Sr. became the first head pro, no long before Sam Snead and Ben Hogan began coming to the club to work on their game. A new generation of golfers like Jimmy Demaret and Claude Harmon, Sr. (Butch's dad) came along, and River Oaks earned a reputation as the hub of Houston golf.Designed by the legendary Donald Ross, River Oaks is a timeless, traditional layout that is one of the most exclusive in the country. The high-dollar real estate that Ross had to work with was small, but covered with stately old oak trees and ancient pines all nestled along the banks of Buffalo Bayou.The layout features some of the area's best short holes-distance isn't an issue, but accuracy is imperative. In addition to the oaks and pines, the skinny fairways are lined with azaleas, magnolias, and dogwoods. The greens are small, slick, and make for challenging targets.Other notes: Joe Finger came along in 1967 to initiate improvements of the greens, tees, and the rerouting of a few holes.Getting there : From I-45 south take the Hwy. 610 exit west and find Westheimer Rd. Turn right and look for River Oaks Blvd, where you'll turn left-it will lead to the clubhouse.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3040,,,,,,
18505,River Place Country Club,"River Place is finally established after years of financial problems that were resolved when Tom Kite and Roy Bechtol gave the facility new life with a redesign in the early 1990s. Located on the former Wilding Ranch between Lake Austin and Ranch Road 620, the Hill Country terrain is phenomenal, with a creek that dominates the front nine, and some dramatic slopes that never result in level lies.The sloping is evident on No. 1, a 402-yard par 4 that requires a testy approach over a ravine from a downhill lie. No. 4 is tough because the creek rolls along the left side of the 561-yard hole before crossing in front of the green. And No. 7 is one of the toughest: a 430-yard doglegger that bends right around the creek.The back side has a few ponds that come into play, but is void of the pesky creek. The one to watch for is No. 17, a 585-yard monster.Getting there : From Loop 360, take Ranch Rd 2222 going west..

18512,Riverhill Country Club,"Riverhill’s architect, Joe Finger, is a well-traveled Renaissance man who has dabbled in everything from corrugated plastics and dairy farming to college golf and course development. So it says something that he chose Riverhill Country Club as his home. Consistently rated as one of the top courses in all of Texas, Riverhill is a scenic layout with major elevation changes; undulating, elevated greens; lots of water and tough Hill Country brush that wreaks havoc on errant balls.Leon Howard designed the course originally as a 9-hole layout back in 1952, but members eventually commissioned Byron Nelson and Ralph Plummer to improve the layout. Plummer became ill, opening the door for Finger’s contributions. One of his most challenging holes is No. 11, a par 3 that sometimes plays around 200 yards from the tips. With the wind blowing and water on all along the right side, it’s an intimidating tee shot when you’re aiming at the tiny green.Hole 4 is the most difficult rated hole, a 458-yard par 4. Another tough challenge is the long par 5 14th, which happens to be proceeded by another long par 5, creating a tough stretch of golf on the back side.Getting there : From I-10 west, take Hwy. 16 south.
