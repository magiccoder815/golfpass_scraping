6869,Granite Ridge Golf Club,"North Granite Ridge Golf Club spans 320 acres of beautiful woodlands in the heart of Muskoka. The layout plays through large boulders and towering trees across dramatic elevation changes provided by granite ridges, hence the name. The greens are undulating and the fairways are quite narrow, demanding both accuracy and skillful course management. It is home to the longest par 5 in Muskoka at 622 yards from the back tees. The challenges of the golf course are complemented by panoramic views that stretch deep into the forest, providing some scenic respite. Opened in 1999, North Granite Ridge Golf Club is fairly new but it has quickly become one of the area's must-play golf courses.",https://northgraniteridge.com/,,,,,,

6933,Lac La Belle Golf Club,"Formerly known as La Belle Golf Club, Rolling Hills Country Club and Lac La Belle Golf Course. Over the years it has garnered a reputation amongst locals for being one of the best golf courses in southeastern Wisconsin. The course wanders across lush, gently rolling countryside that is studded with stands of mature trees. Meandering streams come into play, as do strategically placed bunkers. The classic layout has a character that you won't find on modern courses but its challenges and playability have withstood the test of time. Beginners can approach the golf course with confidence while more advanced players can enjoy a casual round that still offers a challenge.",https://clubatlaclabelle.com/,,,,,,

6941,Cedar Creek Country Club,"The first course developed along Cedar Creek Lake, this one opened in 1967 as part of a rural retirement community. The course’s namesake waterway slinks its way through the course, coming into play six times as you wind your way through the tree-lined fairways.Holes of note include the 470-yard, par 4 No. 6, which dives through a chute of trees to a large green. Thankfully, this monster is void of hazards. On the back No. 13 is feast or famine–a short par 5 at 483 yards, but a pond sits in the middle of the fairway. The ender at Cedar Creek goes 520 yards and is fairly manageable if you can keep it out of the trees.Getting there : From Hwy. 175 east, take the Kemp exit, and look for the signs to the course.",http://www.cedarcreekcountryclub.com/,,,,,,

6972,Portage Country Club,"Portage Country Club is situated along the scenic shores of Swan Lake. Opened in 1930, the golf course has a traditional layout that is both challenging and playable. At 6,356 yards from the back tees, it is shorter than most championship courses you will find today but the layout still has plenty to offer besides length. There is a mix of holes that are wide-open and some that are framed by stands of mature trees. The rolling terrain provides subtle but tricky undulations in the greens and fairways as well as the occasional double-tiered green. One of the most memorable holes for both its level of difficulty and the scenery is the par-4 third. This no. 1 handicap hole plays along the lake and forces you to keep a close eye on the target.",https://portagecc.net/,,,,,,
6975,Prairie du Chien Country Club,,https://play18atpdccc.com/,,,,,,
6976,Lake Wisconsin Country Club,"Lake Wisconsin Country Club is located on the outskirts of Prairie du Sac, just a 30-minute drive from both Madison and the Wisconsin Dells. The golf course is quite short at 5,881 yards, which makes it pleasantly walkable, but it is certainly not an easy course. The front nine plays across rolling hills while the back nine is centered upon the manmade Lake Wisconsin. The bunkering throughout the golf course is minimal, but it is strategic and fair. The small, fast greens have enough undulations to give them some character but they are not overly difficult though the tricky doglegs shaped by stands of mature trees will test your accuracy. The par-3 12th hole is the signature thanks to a challenging island tee. Lake Wisconsin Country Club's 16th hole also has a memorable tee shot between two towering oak trees followed by a short iron to a well guarded green that backs onto the Wisconsin River.",https://www.lakewisconsincc.com/,,,,,,
6980,Meadowbrook Country Club,"Meadowbrook Country Club in Racine is just a short drive from Milwaukee and Kenosha as well as northeastern Illinois. The golf course is interwoven with a meandering creek that is connected to three ponds, all of which come into play on several holes throughout the course. The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings. Meadowbrook C.C. has hosted several events over the years, including numerous Wisconsin state opens.",https://www.meadowbrookracine.com/?utm_source=redirect&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=mccdicarlo%20redirect,,,,,,

6985,Reedsburg Country Club,"Reedsburg Country Club is a championship golf course that requires both accuracy and strategy. Originally opened as a nine-hole course in 1925, only three of the original holes still exist today. The course underwent a major renovation in the 1970s that expanded it to a full 18 holes. At only 6,300 yards from the back tees, it is shorter than most modern championship golf courses but don't let the yardage fool you. This course will test you on even its shortest holes. Every hole features either out-of-bounds or a lateral water hazard on one or both sides. Reedsburg Country Club's greens range from small to large but what they have in common is that they are all fast, undulating, and framed with pot bunkers. A creek also meanders in front of the greens of five holes.",https://reedsburgcountryclub.com/,,,,,,

7025,"House On The Rock Resort, The (Front/Back Course at House On The Rock Resort, The)","The Springs Course is the original course at the House on the Rock Resort & Golf Club. There is also the North Nine Course, which was added more than 20 years after the first course. Despite the difference in age and length, both golf courses provide rounds that are as scenic as they are challenging. The Springs is a Robert Trent Jones design, although the lush terrain of the Wisconsin River Valley also deserves credit. The course sweeps along the valley floor and incorporates Jones signature elements, including narrow landing areas and plenty of bunkering. Water hazards also come into play on almost every hole. Two notable holes are the ninth and 18th, par 4s that wind back to a massive double green guarded by water on one side and sand traps on the other.",https://www.thehouseontherock.com/,,,,,,

7032,Cherry Hills Lodge & Golf Course,"Cherry Hills Golf Course sprawls across gently rolling countryside in Sturgeon Bay. The layout tumbles across a variety of elevation changes that make for some challenging, hard-to-read greens. Some have even compared them to Pinehurst's famous greens. Be prepared to have your short-game skills thoroughly tested. The front nine is slightly more forgiving than the back nine where the fairways are narrower and many are lined with out-of-bounds stakes. Water hazards come into play one four holes and there are a few strategically placed sand traps. The golf course is challenging but fair and not too intimidating for beginners, especially since at just over 6,200 yards, it is a manageable length. In addition to the course, there is also a lighted driving range at Cherry Hills G.C.",https://www.golfcherryhills.com/,,,,,,

Along with its new name, the club also revealed improvements to the playability and condition of the 18-hole course. The design of the golf course was largely determined by the scenic topography, which is covered with mature trees and dotted with ponds. There are also a few streams that meander across the landscape. Rivermoor Golf Club is a proud member of the Audubon Sanctuary System. Beyond providing a secluded setting and great scenery, the terrain also makes for a challenging round. The trees frame most of the holes and water hazards come into play on a few holes. There are also strategically placed bunkers with which to contend.",https://rivermoorgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

The course originally opened in 1927 as a nine-holer but was renovated and lengthened in the 1980s but the front nine wasn't added until 2004. Only a few holes remained from the original nine-hole course, but they play just as they did in the 20s. The newer front nine has a link-style design that demands accuracy off the tee with 29 sand traps strategically placed throughout the nine holes. There are a variety of other hazards as well. As you move onto the back nine, the golf course's character changes completely. The holes have a traditional design and they are much more wooded with mature trees framing almost every hole, just waiting to knock down an errant tee shot or missed approach.",https://www.golfrrcc.com/,,,,,,

The Oaks is the 18-hole course and it is joined by the nine-hole Pines Course. The names of both courses are indicative of the mature woodland landscape you will find on each. The championship Oaks is a challenging but straightforward layout. You can play it well the first time you play it, so long as you are able to keep it in the short grass. Strategically placed sand traps come into play along many of the greens and there are water hazards on four holes. One of the most memorable holes is the 14th, an uphill par 4 that has three towering oak trees on the left side of the fairway that cause a blind shot to the green.",https://christmasmountainvillage.co/,,,,,,
