7657,Picture Butte Golf Club,"Located just north of Lethbridge, Picture Butte Golf Club sits on top of a coulee, providing views that span across the surrounding mountains. Since opening in 1945, the club has hosted a variety of tournaments including the Canadian Senior Match Play Championship in 2006. It has become one of southern Alberta's most popular golfing destinations. The entire golf course is comprised of three nines that are played in different 18-hole combinations. The Heritage/Homestead course has a large lake right in the center that comes into play on both the front and back. This combination is the longest of the three. The holes are mostly straightforward except for the menacing fifth hole on the Homestead nine. This par 4 sharply wraps around the lake, requiring a tough carry over water.",https://www.picturebuttegolf.com/,,,,,,

7690,"Ranch Golf & Country Club, The","Jeremy Golf & Country Club possesses a highly acclaimed, by publications such as Golf Digest, championship course. Arnold Palmer designed the course, which is nestled in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains creating several elevation changes and elevated tee boxes. It features difficult fairways that are scattered with pines, aspen trees, and low brush and nearly all of them are bunkered and heavily sloped. The greens are medium to large in size and are well protected by bunkers. East Canyon Creek runs through the golf course and it is often used as a water hazards on many holes. Jeremy Golf & Country Club has four sets of tee boxes to adapt to all skill levels and abilities.",https://www.thejeremy.com/,,,,,,

7706,Taber Golf Club,"Taber Golf Club originally opened in 1969 as a nine-hole course. The second nine wasn't added until a decade later, lengthening the course to just over 6,700 yards. The golf course stretches across what was once the site of an old mine. The terrain is mostly flat, making it an easy golf course to walk but also subjecting it to the wind. On blustery days, the course can be especially tricky. The front nine, known among regulars as the ""Country Club Nine,"" has more trees than the back but it has a more player-friendly nature that will appeal to beginners. Taber Golf Club's challenging back nine will have you using every club in your bag to maneuver the twisting doglegs and subtle contours. Strategically placed bunkers come into play throughout, and there is also the occasional water hazard.",https://www.tabergolf.ca/,,,,,,

7720,Wainwright Golf & Country Club,"Wainwright Golf Club is a two-hour drive from Edmonton and it sits just one hour from Lloydminster. The course has a traditional layout featuring a mix of tree-lined and links holes that offer plenty of variety. With narrow fairways lined with deciduous trees and small, tricky green, it's a golf course that demands accuracy. Straight shots will be generously rewarded and there is thick rough waiting to penalize errant shots. The original front nine is tighter than the back nine and there are more trees framing most of the holes. Though the back nine is more open, it's not any less challenging. In addition to the course, Wainwright Golf Club also has a practice facility with a driving range that extends more than 250 yards with several different targets and also a large putting green.",https://golfwainwright.com/,,,,,,
7721,Water Valley Golf & Country Club,"Located less than a half hour north of Cochrane, Water Valley Golf & Country Club, as its name implies, is nestled in a scenic valley tucked away among scenic hills. The woodland layout features stands of poplar and spruce trees as well as lush and abundant vegetation along the fairways, which gives them a completely secluded feel. The golf course originally opened in 1988 with only nine holes but expanded to a full 18-holes just a few years later in 1994. There have been several renovations to Water Valley Golf & C.C. since it first opened including widening of the fairways and completely rebuilt greens on three of the holes on the back nine. The new nine forms the front and wraps around the original nine holes. It has more sand and water than the original, which means you'll catch a break on the back nine.",https://watervalleygolf.ca/,,,,,,

7727,Wetaskiwin Golf Club,"Montgomery Glen Golf & Country Club is part of the Country Club Tour courses, a group of four Edmonton-area golf courses. A CCT membership lets you play on all four. Montgomery Glen has level, open fairways that give the course a seemingly mild look but don't be fooled, water, and trees were liberally incorporated into the design. The par-3 12th is the signature hole. With a creek that runs along the entire right side, both the tee and approach shots are over water. You'll need a long, straight shot to navigate the tree-lined chute that leads to the green. It's a tough hole but surprisingly not the golf course's most difficult. That title goes to the par-4 third, which features a large spruce tree in the center of the fairway and a water hazard on the right.",https://countryclubtour.com/,,,,,,

The Player Course is routed through the different neighborhoods and it is joined by the Wyboo Golf Club in the adjacent community of Deercreek Plantation. The 18-hole golf course stretches to just over 6,900 yards from the back tees. It is a great course for long hitters but it also forces golfers to employ creative strategies on each hole. The layout is tight in some spots and thanks to the interconnected lakes, water hazards come into play on several holes. It is a golf course that will make you think but at the same time it is playable for a range of different skill levels.",https://www.theplayerscourseatwyboo.com/,,,,,,

It originally started as a nine-hole course but another nine-hole course was added later and the two courses were eventually combined to form the Pines Course. The course has a par of 71 and it is 6,731 yards from the back tees.Seaview's Pine Course doesn't provide scenic views but it does offer a good game. Some even prefer the Pines course because of its quiet location behind the resort's hotel and also because of its more challenging features. The golf course has tight fairways lined with trees, medium-sized greens that are undulating, and strategically placed bunkers.",https://www.seaviewgolf.com/,,,,,,
