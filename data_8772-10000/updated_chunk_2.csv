9185,"Dieppe-Pourville, Golf de","Under the impetus of English and Scottish golfers, ""a golf course to play the old royal game"" came into existence in 1897, resulting in the creation of Golf de Dieppe-Pourville. The mastermind behind it, Willie Park Junior, designed an expansive 18-hole course across 60 hectares. This course provides captivating vistas of Pourville and Varengeville's white cliffs. Golf de Dieppe-Pourville rests on a hilly plateau, adorned with abundant trees and water hazards, and the 5,695-meter Par 70 course provides a rather technical layout.

The DGV Golf & Nature certificate in silver confirms this success.A varied round of golf awaits you on a course that will give you a lot of pleasure, but also requires a tactical game.We hope you have a great game!",https://www.golfclubolching.de/,,,,,,

Past the beautiful things, you walk along the oak grove to the clubhouse - in true half-timbered style.A friendly welcome, perhaps a quick purchase in the pro shop, and then you can start your round. The precise allocation of starting times - even during the week - means there is no crowding at the tee.After a few strokes on the driving range and a few skillful chips and putts, you head to the first tee. You get a first impression of the course at tee 1: a dogleg to the right over meadows means that many a short tiger line drive disappears among the Heidschnucken. Precise play is required across the entire course, scattered drives quickly end up in the dense forest, in the numerous bunkers and lakes. A course that is certainly difficult; played tactically, however, it is an absolute must for every golfer. Add to that the beautiful heath landscape through which the 18 completely differently designed holes with their well-kept fairways and greens run. After the game, you can relax wonderfully on the club terrace with a view of the course. Anyone who wants to can join one another at the long tables. The boss is also always up for a chat. He is happy to talk about the beginnings at the club, the daily maintenance of the course or give tips for your own game.A successful day of golf is coming to an end - a shame, actually, some holes could certainly have been played differently...",https://www.gc-badbevensen.de/,,,,,,

9493,"Island Golf Club, The","Pleasure Island is now home to a new links-style track that opened for play in 2002, replacing the old course that faded away around 1980. With its unique location on the island of pleasure in the intercoastal waterway and Lake Sabine, this 6,900-yard track has a bit of character, with loads of donated Florida palm trees as well as uncharacteristic elevation changes that were the result of the dredged ship channel. In fact, the island itself came about in the early 1900s as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cut the ship channel and piled mud from the bottom of Sabine Lake.Getting there : Once on Pleasure Island, look for the water tower on that looks like a golf ball sitting on a tee.",https://www.pleasureislandtx.com/rec_golf.html,,,,,,
