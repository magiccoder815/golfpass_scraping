8641,Westminster Trails,"Westminster Trails Golf Club is one of the most popular public golf courses in London, Ontario. It is a link-style layout with wide fairways that are bordered by frustrating fescue. There are also lakes and ponds that come into play on a few holes. The real challenges of the course lie in the tricky greens. The signature hole is the par-3 second hole, which may seem short at only 100 yards but be sure not to underestimate it. The hole plays to a saucer-shaped green that is almost entirely engulfed by water. It is the sister course of two other popular London courses, Maple Ridge Golf Club and East Park Golf Garden.",https://golfnorth.ca/westminstertrails/,,,,,,
