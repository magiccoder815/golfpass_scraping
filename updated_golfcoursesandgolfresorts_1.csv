The country club sits just 10 minutes outside of downtown Cincinnati.A Scottish golfer and designer, Bendelow created several Midwest courses. Bendelow designed 800-plus North American courses, working with land he was assigned: In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, architects didn't get their turf, rocks and water features trucked in. Born Sept. 2, 1868, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bendelow began golfing when he was 9 years old, with his dad at the Balgownie Links, which now goes by Royal Aberdeen Golf Club - founded in 1780, Royal Aberdeen Golf Club is the world's sixth-oldest, and it's clear that Bendelow had rich inspiration to draw on back in Scotland.After a round of golf at the Western Hills Country Club, head back to the Grill Porch for nibbles and sips.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10555,,,,,,

Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3302,,,,,,

The course has a traditional design that is player-friendly enough to appeal to beginners while also offering a few challenges. There are numerous bunkers strategically placed throughout and water hazards also come into play on a few holes. It is not the most formidable test but more advanced players will still have fun, especially if they are just looking for a quick round.

While this is Scott's first attempt in playing the role of a course architect, it also reveals his depth of experience in the golf course industry. The design goals of building a course that would be enjoyable for high handicappers as well as low handicappers was met in this design.The course features wide player-friendly fairways. Also, water comes into play on only two holes which makes navigating this course easier for high handicappers. A large natural turf driving range and 10,000 square foot practice green is available as a warm-up or practice area.Soldiers Creek Golf Club is owned by the Norman Woerner family. Norman is a member of the Woerner Turf family of sod producers. Woerner Turf is a world-wide leader in turf production. The company provides turf for many golf courses ranging from Augusta National to new courses in Hong Kong. They also supply the turf for the NFL Super Bowl and the NFL Pro Bowl in Hawaii.Southern Turf Nurseries provided the Tif Eagle for Soldiers Creek Golf Club. This turf grass is considered by many to be the best-of-the-best turf for southern golf course greens. The fairways and roughs are Tif 419, a dense-growing emerald-colored grass that's perfect for plush fairways.The greens feature Tif Eagle, the newest and best-of-the-best southern turf grass for golf course greens. An increasingly popular choice for new golf courses and redesigns, this turf permits a closer cut, thus allowing for smoother, faster greens.Located only several miles from Alabama's sun-kissed Gulf Coast, this new 18 hole championship course is part of the Woerner Preserve Resort. Our friendly staff welcomes you to play the newest course on the Gulf Coast. Yes, we are now open. Come spend some time with family or friends. Relax and enjoy a round of golf in this natural setting.DIRECTIONS: From I-10, take exit 44 (Gulf Shores Pkwy/Hwy 59 South). Travel south on Hwy 59 for approx. 18 miles.

Always helpful, with smiles on their faces, and particularly friendly to out-of-towners, it sure makes it a joy to play golf when you’re treated with that sort of charming hospitality.Golf is even better nowadays in Decatur because of the renovated greens, which look pristine and roll true. This course is flat, with water in play on about 3 holes, and the par 36 design offers a good combination of holes. The opener is testy, and not an easy par–it plays 440 yards to a par 4. There are three par 3s, two of which require long irons, and three par 5s, one of which is listed as the number one handicap: the No. 6 hole at 542 yards.Getting there : From Hwy, 380 exit, take the Airport exit and cross over the highway.

Like many of Ross' designs, the phrase ""hard par, easy bogey"" holds true here. The layout features small greens with crown centers that are sloped back to front.

Opened in 1962, it was one of the area's first nine-hole courses. It is an ideal course for beginners, offering a layout that is gentle but has a few subtle challenges. For more advanced players, the golf course is great for squeezing in a quick round or for getting in some short game practice. It can be played as a relatively quick 18-hole round too. In addition to the course, Olde Fort has a driving range as well as chipping and putting greens for golfers to use. The course may not have the most challenging design or extensive amenities, but it is popular nonetheless since it is one of the best values in the area.",,,,,,,

The parkland layout has a beautifully rolling terrain that provides dramatic elevation changes throughout. The course has a balance of excellent shot values and interesting challenges that will appeal to players of all skill levels.

There are numerous bunkers lurking around the greens and water hazards come into play on nearly every hole, 16 to be exact.

Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

This infamous hole features a tee that sits high above a treacherous green that is surrounded on three sides by water and even further protected with three sand traps. The hole is also completely isolated thanks to the surrounding mature trees. There is another par 3 on the golf course that is almost as equally tough, the 15th.

The holes on the backside are more heavily treed and demand greater accuracy. Strategically placed bunkers frame the greens, making the approaches even more intimidating, and the river also comes into play. Straight shots will be rewarded at Pine River G.C. but it's not an overly punishing layout for the high handicapper.

The course has been around since the 1950s and has since matured into a challenging round. The greens are somewhat smaller than those you would find on a more modern golf course but the fairways are wide and player friendly. The greens will test your accuracy but they're not overly challenging. Meandering streams crisscross the golf course, cutting through fairways and running alongside some of the holes. There are also several ponds that come into play. In addition to the water, there are bunkers lurking along the greensides and fairways as well as a few strategically positioned trees. The Tawas Creek layout is challenging but playable, making it a great venue for golf tournaments and events.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/7980,,,,,,

When the second course, Mountain Ridge, was added, Betsie Valley also underwent a major renovation. The course retained its original playability but it was made more challenging to appeal to more advanced golfers. Both golf courses are spread across rolling hills covered with mature pine forests, encapsulating the best that northern Michigan golf has to offer. Although they share the same scenic landscape, the courses have a unique character as well as a different set of challenges. Betsie Valley's tight layout and small greens make it a true shot-maker's course. Many of the greens are also severely sloped, making them even more challenging. One of the toughest holes is the par-5 10th, which doglegs right and plays longer than the scorecard indicates.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/902,,,,,,

The holes are fairly straightforward and there are no hidden hazards. The golf course does require a fair amount of accuracy though with mature trees lining the fairways. There are also strategically placed sand bunkers guarding most of the greens. It might not what you are looking for if you are searching for a formidable test, but it is great for a casual round.

This challenging design is known for its undulating greens that will test even the most seasoned players. Each hole has a unique design that combines strategically placed bunkers, including large waste bunkers, and sloping grass swales. There is also carefully sculpted mounding along the edges of the fairways. On top of that, water comes into play on nearly every hole. English Turn's signature hole, the 15th, is a tricky par 5 with an island green but it's the final hole, a par 4 with water all along the left side, that is rumored to be the golf course's toughest.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14340,,,,,,

You face uneven lies and a few blind shots thanks to the terrain but you'll also get scenic views of the surrounding area. Accuracy is important to have but it's not an overly punishing layout if you happen to be errant. The golf course has a challenging start with an uphill par 3 as the opening hole.

Sculpted mounding and native grasses frame the generous landing areas and you'll even find Dye's trademark railroad ties framing the greens. There are also several lakes that come into play throughout. Oak Harbor Golf Club's seventh and 15th holes are particularly notable for their intimidating tee shots over water.

The club stayed put for half a century, noted for the presence of Harvey Penick. Then after a huge local debate, the facility was moved to Riverside Drive in East Austin. From there it made it another 35 years before moving to its current Davenport Ranch location.The current ACC layout, designed by Pete Dye, rests on the shores of Lake Austin and the Colorado River. Dye didn’t veer from his usual method of creating an impressively difficult track using his trademark railroad ties, deep pot bunkers, and huge undulations.The opening holes play along Lake Austin, and are more of a links-style design. Afterwards the Hill Country takes effect, featuring canyons, ravines, creeks, and unbelievable views.The back nine features many outstanding holes, including the 446-yard No. 11, which deceptively doglegs left along a canyon before requiring an approach over that same deep ravine. The par 3 No. 16 also stands out, featuring a long carry over another canyon.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2747,,,,,,

It is a par-60 executive layout that offers the perfect level of challenge for beginners, juniors, and senior golfers. It is the sister course to Delray Beach Golf Club, a championship course that is less than a mile away. Opened in 1972, the golf course has a classic design that measures just over 3,000 yards. The terrain is mostly flat, making it an enjoyable course to walk. Despite its length the holes have the feel of a championship course. There are 14 par 3s, a fair share of which are quite challenging as opposed to the uniform par 3s you see on some executive courses. For more advanced players, it is a great place to get in a quick round of practice.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1999,,,,,,

The traditional layout has withstood the test of time as a challenging but playable layout. The course was designed to blend seamlessly into the natural setting while still testing your shot-making skills. You won’t find any man-made water hazards or artificial mounding on this golf course, instead you’ll be challenged by natural streams and ponds and mature evergreens. At first glance, the layout is seemingly wide open, but don’t let your guard down because the fairways are actually quite tight and many of them are strategically lined with trees. In keeping with the time it was built, the greens are smaller than those you would find on most modern golf courses and heavily protected by sand traps.

The diverse course offers everything from Scottish-style bunkers to sparkling lakes. Tall golden fescue rough borders the fairways and the greens are large and undulating. The course is seemingly short at only 6,236 yards but it shouldn't be taken lightly. It's much more challenging than it appears. The layout finishes with two of its toughest holes. The 17th has a tough green fiercely guarded by out-of-bounds and the course saved the most difficult hole for last. This par 3 will test even the most seasoned golfers. In addition to the golf course, Colts Neck also has a 25-station driving range that stays open late. It's a great spot for getting in some practice after work.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/19943,,,,,,

The entire Wedgewood layout sprawls across gentle undulating terrain, providing subtle breaks throughout that will test your skills. There are two holes that are particularly memorable, the 13th, one of the toughest par 4s in the area, and the 17th, a tough par 5. The 13th is a lengthy par 4 that requires a second shot over water with a long club to a difficult target.

Not with the fast greens, dramatic elevation changes and swerving fairways available at Oak Valley in Beaumont.A Lee Schmidt and Brian Curley design, Oak Valley is probably best known for greens that are anything but desert typical. Speed is the name of the game here, with a tap sometimes too much on a downhill putt.Recognition does not travel that quickly. It took a decade for Oak Valley to get a four star rating from Golf Digest. Once it did, Beaumont suddenly became a golf stopping spot on the Palm Springs express. Now, you're considered a smart golfer if you linger on the way to Palm Springs.""It's a nice getaway from the crowds in the desert, as well as some of the other, more populated golf areas,"" head pro Scott Arnold said. ""It's almost like being in the country. No houses line the fairways. Each hole is different.

At just over 6,600 yards it is not particularly long, but it provides plenty of challenges. It is a tight course that will test your accuracy with narrow fairways lined with trees. The small greens that are heavily protected by well placed bunkers demand thoughtful strategy and pinpoint control. The golf course offers a fair challenge but it is still accessible for beginners, especially from the forward tees.

The relatively flat course is wide-open, subjecting it to the blustery ocean breezes. The wind is definitely the most challenging factor on the golf course, with proof provided by the wind-shaped live oaks and Yaupon trees that are scattered throughout. Water hazards come into play on nine holes. There are also 37 strategically placed bunkers and challenging rough areas.

The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings.

The terrain accounts for most of the golf course's difficulty but the lofty elevations also provide stunning views. The natural contours helped to determine the strategic placement of the bunkers.

The championship layout incorporates the plentiful water and woods of the natural terrain. The white sand bunkers that are strategically placed throughout add a beautiful contrast to the lush green of the golf course. The undulating terrain is one of the layout's most prominent features. Elaborate hills and greenside swales protect many of the putting complexes. The putting surfaces on the front nine are relatively calm when compared to the back nine where most of the greens are double-tiered, ridged, or layered. The par-4 15th is one of Stonebridge Golf Club's most scenic and challenging holes. With water in front, back, and right of the green, this is one of the toughest approaches on the back nine.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15148,,,,,,

The golf course is a shot maker's layout that will test your skills but it is still player friendly enough to appeal to all skill levels. You'll need a sharp short game for sure, but you won't need much length on this rather short layout. Some form of water appears on nearly every hole, including some holes that play right along the Sound, and the undulating greens can be tough. It's a challenging-but-fun round that is worth playing for the scenery alone.

Opened in 1962, it was one of the area's first nine-hole courses. It is an ideal course for beginners, offering a layout that is gentle but has a few subtle challenges. For more advanced players, the golf course is great for squeezing in a quick round or for getting in some short game practice. It can be played as a relatively quick 18-hole round too.

Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

The natural wetlands and vegetation were carefully preserved, earning all four courses certification as Audubon Cooperative Sanctuaries. The Players Club was designed by North Carolina native Tim Cate. It stands out from the other courses thanks to its stunning views of the rolling Carolina countryside. The challenging layout is quite memorable too with narrow fairways that demand accuracy and numerous waste bunkers strategically placed throughout.

It offers all the facets of Southern golf without the crowds. The Yadkin Valley stretches east from the Blue Ridge Mountains across the rolling hills of the North Carolina Piedmont. Like many golf courses in the area, Yadkin is routed up and down rolling terrain and through mature trees. The layout is challenging with an interesting mix of holes, none of which run parallel to each other. The par 3s are long and there are a few reachable par 5s. The par 4s will make you think, requiring thoughtful drives and approaches. Strategically placed bunkers and mounding lurk throughout and water hazards come into play on a few holes. Yadkin Country Club is a tough but fair layout that emphasizes strategy over strength.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10328,,,,,,

It has a few challenges in store but overall it is a player-friendly course that beginners can approach with confidence. The layout has a wide open front nine before it moves onto hillier, more wooded terrain. The first nine holes are more forgiving than the back nine, allowing some room for error off the tees. The back nine is a scenic round of holes, sprawling across gently rolling hills studded with mature trees. There are also some challenging par 3s that require a carry over water. Sedgewood Country Club is a diverse golf course that is approachable for all skill levels and made even more accommodating thanks to three different sets of tees.",,,,,,,

Opened in 2010 in an effort to bring world class golf to western Massachusetts, the club has since garnered a local following. The par-71 layout is unique in that it has six par 3s and five par 5s. There are also some par 4s in the 450-yard range. The 6,521-yard length indicated on the scorecard can be deceiving since it feels much longer when you're playing it. The golf course has plenty of variety, including dogleg lefts, doglegs rights, short holes, and long holes. Thanks to its mountaintop locale, Cold Spring C.C. offers stunning views that are as diverse as the holes. The vistas from the elevated tees and greens stretch to the Berkshires, Connecticut, and Vermont. From the golf course's highest tee box on the par-3 10th, you'll have a panoramic view of central Massachusetts.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/34644,,,,,,

The abundance of mature trees is the layout's defining characteristic. They shape the doglegs and line the fairways, making accuracy a necessity. There is also a surprising amount of elevation changes throughout that make the course even more challenging. The occasional water hazard comes into play but they do not pose a serious threat. Good course management is key but overall it is a playable round no matter what your skill level though it doesn't hurt to warm up on the club's driving range or putting green. Pine Hills G.C. location nestled within the forest may explain why it is still one of the best-kept secrets in central Wisconsin.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13668,,,,,,

The golf course blends seamlessly with the scenic surroundings. Strategically placed bunkers fiercely protect the greens and golfers should also be prepared for some tricky forced carries. The fairways are generous and forgiving though. The course is a fair test but it is especially tough on windy days. The interior, tree-lined holes contrast nicely with the waterfront holes and they have the added benefit of protection from the prevailing sea breezes. North Shore Country Club is a player-friendly layout that both beginners and seasoned players can enjoy, which is why it has become one of the Outer Banks' most popular golfing destinations.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10239,,,,,,

It's the many elevation changes though, which can range from subtle to dramatic, that are the true test of this golf course. Be prepared for several tricky uphill, downhill, and sidehill lies.

The creation of the golf course was spearheaded by Orator Woodward, youngest song of Jell-O magnate Donald Woodward. He believed the landscape of rolling hills and meandering streams was the ideal setting for a round of golf. The natural contours of the terrain helped to determine the placement of the bunkers. Water comes into play on a few holes at LeRoy Country Club, most notably on the finishing two.

The fairways were cut through forests of mature hardwoods but they are wide and carefully sculpted to direct balls toward the middle. Skillful players could even try to use the contours to their advantage. Each hole has a bunkers but the bunkering is not excessive. In addition to the mounding and bunkering, the undulating terrain provides natural elevation changes. The golf course finishes with what is arguably its toughest hole. This monster par 5 is 620 yards from the back tees. It requires a drive over a ravine with a natural waste area to the left.

The Red Course is the shorter of the two courses at 6,237 yards from the back tees. Although it is more than 500 yards shorter, it still offers plenty of challenges. There are water hazards that come into play as well as several strategically placed bunkers. One of the trickiest holes is the par-3 third, which requires a carry over a massive lake to a small green. Although there are also mature trees lining the fairways, the holes are fairly straightforward. Beginners can approach this golf course with confidence but more advanced players will find it to be a fun casual round. The Gold Course is a better option for a tougher challenge. Cedarbrook also has a full practice range and several putting and chipping greens.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/11451,,,,,,

The mountainous landscape provides plenty of elevation changes that make it difficult to find a flat lie. At 6,254 yards, the course is short but it is still a challenging round with narrow, tree-lined fairways that demand accuracy. There is hardly any water on the golf course but with strategically placed bunkers, sidehill lies, and towering trees to contend with, golfers will hardly notice the absence of water hazards. Great Rock's signature hole is the challenging 10th. This par-4 beast is a double uphill climb with a seemingly flat green, but if you read it that way, you're in for some trouble.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/20370,,,,,,

Shorty was a hacker and his short course is designed to accommodate the lesser golfer with its executive-like 2,385-yard length.Plaster's design opens up with three par 3s, followed by another on No. 5. Every par 4 plays 350 yards or less, and the sole par 5 is only 475 yards. Not many non-par-3 9-holers are blessed with lights, but this one is. The same goes for the driving range, so you can definitely spend some hours at this nice little country course.Getting there : From I-45 south, exit Dixie Farm Rd. and turn right. Drive 8 miles to where it dead-ends, then turn on Hwy 35. Drive 8 miles to Fairway Dr. and turn left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2726,,,,,,

The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings.

There is an interesting mix of holes ranging from reachable par 5s to short, tough par 3s and each hole has a distinct character. The greens are fast and the gently rolling terrain provides some subtle breaks that can be tricky. Bunkering is sparsely but strategically placed along the fairways and greensides. There are also a few water hazards that come into play at Apollo Elks Country Club.

The greens have quite a bit of variation from one to the next but mostly they are very large and extremely fast. Although the greens only have mild contouring, the rippling landscape still provides plenty of challenges throughout. Strategically placed bunkers perfectly complement the dramatic elevation changes, ranging from pot bunkers to vast expanses of sand. Inniscrone Golf Club's ninth hole is a memorable one since it encapsulates the course's appeal with a ridge of cross-bunkers just off the tee and even more along the left side.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1370,,,,,,

The small, heavily bunkered greens make the course even trickier. Meadowlands Golf & Country Club's signature hole is the par-4 14th.

The course is an enjoyable round no matter what skill level. It is not an overly difficult or long course, but it was never meant to be a formidably tough round. The design was meant to appeal to not only high handicappers but also golfers who are looking for a casual but interesting round. For this reason, the resort is an ideal place for a relaxed outing. The golf course is playable but that doesn't mean golfers won't come across a fair amount of challenges. The 13th and 18th are two particularly tricky holes. The former is a par 4 with six sand traps lining a narrow fairway, and the finishing hole is a par 3 with water lining another narrow fairway and a large pond behind the raised green.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/11492,,,,,,

The winding layout has many doglegs and incorporates a variety of elevation changes. Golfers should be prepared for a fair amount of blind shots as well as uneven lies. The spacious golf course has several holes that will please long hitters, but this layout will test your accuracy and course-management skills too. Water comes into play most memorably on Greencastle's signature third hole where there is a man-made waterfall and fountain but the par-4 10th is the toughest. This hole has an island green that is cut in half by a large drop in elevation, a good test for the two following holes which are not any less challenging.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/11646,,,,,,

The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times. Other multiple winners of this longstanding PGA Tour event include Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Nick Price and Ben Crenshaw.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/21496,,,,,,

The golf course is interwoven with a meandering creek that is connected to three ponds, all of which come into play on several holes throughout the course. The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings. Meadowbrook C.C. has hosted several events over the years, including numerous Wisconsin state opens.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1750,,,,,,

Each hole was carefully designed to test your course-management skills and overall abilities, though accurate shot-making and ball placement are more of a priority than length in scoring well. There are many challenges throughout the golf course including deep rough, expansive wetlands, eight ponds, and sloped greens that are often tiered. The rolling landscape provides dramatic elevation changes that cause tricky, uneven lies and there are also well placed bunkers bordering the greens and fairways. Although it is a tough course, generous fairways and multiple tee boxes allow players of all skill levels to enjoy Willow Valley Golf Course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/27650,,,,,,

The three different nines are natural named Blue, Ridge, and Trail. Tucked away in the hills of northeastern Pennsylvania, the golf courses provide stunning scenery and views. All of the holes were carefully carved from the surrounding woodlands and molded into the hillsides. An abundance of trees characterizes the course, giving all of the holes a secluded feel that is further enhanced by the design, which doesn't feature any parallel fairways. The Trail/Blue Course combines the shortest and longest nines but both are considered slightly more challenging than the Ridge nine. The Trail nine possesses two of the four water holes at the club. There is a combination for every skill level and four sets of tees make the nines even more accommodating.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/20683,,,,,,

The heathlands layout feels like a links course with wind being an important factor and thick fescue coming into play. The golf course starts with an especially tough front nine but there are more scoring opportunities on the back. Mounded bunkers and moguls define the movement of the fairways and though there aren't many trees, if you don't keep your shots straight you might find yourself out-of-bounds or lost in the high, wiry grass. Sidehill lies await you as well as a few blind shots. Wyncote's greens have little undulation but the lightning fast putting surfaces are a challenge for players of all skill levels. With a few ""grip it and rip it"" holes mixed in, Wyncote Golf Club is a tough but fair test.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1419,,,,,,

The East Course, the original layout, has hosted a number of legendary players, including Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead, since 1912. Ross carefully sculpted the mountainous landscape to create a course that is both challenging and memorable. It is shorter and tighter than the other course but they are equal in level of difficulty. The golf course is defined by the interesting water hazards that come into play on several holes, but the scenic views are also a draw.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/11909,,,,,,

The rolling terrain provides a variety of elevation changes that range from subtle to dramatic. The course will test you with lightning fast, undulating greens that are protected by sand traps and there is punishing rough bordering the narrow, tree-lined fairways.

Golfers are quickly introduced to the challenges of the golf course with accurate drives being required on several holes of the first half but the back nine is much gentler, it is no less fun though. There are also some straight, uphill holes that golfers will have to contend with on the back nine. One of the golf course's most memorable holes is the par-3 16th, which is a tricky downhill hole that is one of the few that plays over water.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1433,,,,,,

The course starts out mildly with a front nine that sprawls across gently undulating meadows while the back nine gets hillier and more challenging. There are more lakes and strategically placed bunkers that come into play on the back as well as a hidden brook that is just waiting for errant shots. Regent's Glen's 11th hole is one of the most intimidating, with a large lake along the fairway. If you dare to carry a portion of this hazard, you'll be rewarded with a shorter approach to the flagstick, however the hidden brook and deep bunker in front of the green will make that very difficult.

There is a mix of holes that are wide-open and some that are framed by stands of mature trees. The rolling terrain provides subtle but tricky undulations in the greens and fairways as well as the occasional double-tiered green.

The golf course has a traditional design that measures 6,681 yards. It would be a mistake to underestimate Sycamore Springs since there are a number of tricky doglegs that require some deft maneuvering and greens that play fast and true. The golf course is especially tough on windy days. There are a few ponds that come into play and a creek meanders through the course as well.

His unwavering dedication to preserving the natural landscapes he works with is also apparent in the unspoiled beauty of the terrain. Hundreds of mature trees cover the golf course, which extends beyond 7,000 yards from the tips. The fairways twist around a series of lakes and streams and the subtly contoured greens can also be tricky.

There are a few strategically placed sand traps throughout the golf course, which make up for the absence of water. The design is pretty straightforward although there are a few slight doglegs to watch out for.

At nearly 7,300 yards, the layout is on the lengthier side. The golf course features tree-lined corridors that expand into ample fairways and the first noted use of Dye's signature railroad ties and pot bunkers. Dye was inspired by a trip to Scotland, which is apparent throughout the course.

Over the decades, the landscape has matured beautiful with towering trees and fields of native grasses.

The course has been renovated, expanded and redesigned over the 100-plus years of existence. Architect Andrew Green extensively restored the Donald Ross layout in 2018, while also adding some new features as a result of property expansion. The cathedral clock, still on display in the clubhouse, was presented by the participants of the 1920 U.S. Open, and Inverness was the first club to permit the players into the member’s clubhouse.

Both are military golf courses connected to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and open to military and civilian personnel and their guests. The East Course is a small-scale version of the West Course, which makes it more manageable for beginners. With a mostly flat terrain, the course was designed for walking. The layout is straightforward although there are still a few challenges in store. The fairways are straight but they are narrow and require accuracy. The layout is neither simple nor overly difficult. It manages to strike a good balance that appeals to a wide range of skill levels. More advanced players can also use this course as a warm-up to the more demanding longer golf course.Previously known as East at Wright-Patterson Golf Club.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/11084,,,,,,

Opened in 1976, the layout may be more traditional than modern golf courses but it still presents one of the area's most formidable challenges. The course has hosted a variety of events over the years including the U.S. Open Qualifier and the South Carolina Amateur Championship. There are 90 bunkers strategically placed throughout, and the greens are lightning fast. The 11th is one of the most memorable holes.

The headliner of five 18-hole courses at Kiawah Island Resort, the Ocean Course was designed by architect Pete Dye and opened in 1991, just prior to its staging of the 1991 Ryder Cup, otherwise known as the “War by the Shore.” It also hosted the 2012 PGA Championship, won by Rory McIlroy, and the 2021 PGA Championship. The Ocean Course is a windswept coastal layout that plays along a narrow and sandy section on the east end of the island. Its defenses are numerous, from small, elevated greens to huge waste areas that surround plateaued fairways. New tees installed prior to the 2021 PGA Championship can stretch the layout to over 7,800 yards. For daily resort play, the Ocean Course is a walking-only layout that comes with caddies, with the exception of summer months after 10 a.m., when carts are permitted. It has been ranked within the Top 5 public golf courses in the country according to top magazine panels. Elevating the experience further is an oceanside driving range and putting green, as well as its iconic, lowcountry-inspired Ocean Course clubhouse, designed by Robert A.M. Stern architects. The 24,000-square-foot building features the Ryder Cup bar for casual dining and drinks as well as The Atlantic Room for fine dining. In 2021, Kiawah Island added four Ocean Course Cottages, each four-bedroom, 3,800-square-foot units that overlook the course. Accommodations at Kiawah Island include The Sanctuary Hotel as well as villas. Stay-and-play packages that include the Ocean Course an be booked with either option.",http://www.kiawahresort.com/?source=worldgolf,,,,,,

It has received praise as one of the best golf holes in the country. This stunning par 5, which has earned the nickname ""Waterloo,"" has Lake Singleton coming into play. It is definitely the toughest but also one of the most scenic holes as well.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15985,,,,,,

One particularly memorable hole is the first par 3 you reach on the front nine, which requires a forced carry over a pond.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12303,,,,,,

Sprawling across a lush landscape blanketed with century-old oaks and towering pines, the layout is as scenic as it is challenging. While the generous fairways may be player friendly, the difficult approaches to the elevated, well bunkered greens are anything but. The large, pristine white sand bunkers were designed in true Palmer-style, closely following the natural undulations of the land. The gently rolling terrain is unique for the area.

The course runs through the bottomlands of the Elm Fork Trinity River and is loaded with water due to a chain of interconnecting lakes created to collect heavy rains and irrigate the course. While there are no forced carries, water comes into play at least 12 holes, and out-of-bounds is a frequent concern because of the housing community that surrounds the course.No. 5 is the most difficult rated hole–a long dogleg right par 4 that requires a solid tee shot to be in position to reach the green in two. The approach is long and uphill into a severely back-to-front sloping green with a lake on the right and out-of-bounds and bunkers on the left.Two holes later, No. 7 is one of the toughest approaches in all of DFW. This hole plays due south into the prevailing wind, and the elevated green has a depth of only about 25 feet. Bunkers line the back, and the slope in front is significant. Ups and downs are difficult because of the slopes in the green. Take a look at the pin placement when you’re teeing off on No. 4.The good news is that other than out-of-bounds, the course is mostly wide open, so you’ll generally have a shot if you just miss the fairway. The only thick spot for trees is along the creek on holes 14-16.Getting there : Take the Belt Line exit off of 635 and drive north to MacArthur. Turn right (east) and drive to Riverchase Dr., where you’ll turn left. Look for the course on the right side of the road.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14579,,,,,,

And in addition to the hotel-business conference amenities, there’s the spectacular Tom Fazio route awaiting that is open for play only to resort guests and members of the adjoining Stonebriar Country Club.This place embodies Dallas’ northward surge. In the 1960s and 1970s, the new construction was further south in Richardson and Plano, when places like Preston Trails defined the suburbs’ northern edge. However, these days the edge is up this way in Frisco. On this once-barren, extremely flat farmland that served primarily as a hayfield lies the still reasonably flat Fazio track (although he moved over 600,000 yards of earth during construction) that is famous for its lightning-fast, Augusta-like putting surfaces. Made up of the new heat-resistant A-4 bentgrass that was installed recently at Fort Worth’s Colonial Country Club, these babies are certain three-jacks if you fail to pay attention to the pin placements with your approach.The greens are the signature at the Stonebriar, since Fazio’s layout is surprisingly hacker-friendly, mostly void of forced carries with fairways framed by mounds that seem to push the ball back into the fairway. The mounding also has a pleasing aesthetic purpose, making it impossible to see the neighboring fairways and greens.The best hole on the front is No. 2, a 407-yard doglegger that tees uphill over a wetland and involves an approach over a creek into a bunker-guarded green.On the back Fazio dropped in a 5-acre lake that comes into play on Nos. 11 and 14, both 400-yard-plus par 4s. Bunkers line the fairway on No. 11, and the hole doglegs right against the wind. Besides the lake on No. 14, the deep, multi-level green is the problem most likely to drive your score up.Getting there : From Hwy. 121 north, take the Legacy Ave. exit and west.

In fact, first-timers will be confused here. They’ll face intimidating views off the tee that leave doubt as to the problems that loom ahead, and it is definitely possible to lose all of your balls off the tee if you’re struggling.The golf course is just flat-out challenging, especially on the front nine. No. 1 opens up with a creek on the left that cuts in front of the green and generally makes its presence known on every shot. The play here is to stay right and stay away from its subtle presence on the left side. The creek comes into play on Nos. 2, 4, 5, and even No. 9, where it chutes from the fairway in front of the green and surrounds the green of this challenging par 4.All told, water and waste areas are in play on 16 of 18 holes (including every par 3), and the creeks are enhanced by visible lakes and ponds on the back side, even though it is considered a bit easier than the front.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/22710,,,,,,

Two and half years later, the original nine holes opened. Construction on the next nine wrapped up in 2002, leaving 18 outstanding holes for the public.Tangle Oaks is an appropriate name. The course is carved out of an extremely dense oak thicket, sometimes referred to as “the shinnery.” In fact, the shinnery is so thick that it’s played as a lateral hazard– players just drop from where the ball went into the briar-patch-like rough. Length is not imperative, but accuracy is key. The greens are elevated, tilt from back to front, and have a medium to high slope.The fairways are quite tight, due to the oaks. The strategy is simple. Keep it straight or you'll get in trouble. Length is not important, but accuracy is a must.The signature hole is No. 9, a 383-yard par 4 that plays into the teeth of the stiff west Texas wind. To further a golfer's sheer terror, the green is completely fronted by water and a formidable retaining wall. On the back the most notable hole is No. 13, which features an island green. Hole 18 is unique because of the split fairway.Other notes: The county is dry, but Tangle Oaks allows you to bring your own beer.

The 17th is another solid par 4–not as long, but picturesque because the green is completely surrounded by water.Finally, the feature that rounds out the experience at Wildflower is the great condition of the course, enhanced by the new irrigation system that keeps the fairways lush and the greens healthy and rolling true.Getting there : From I-35 north, exit Midway Drive and turn left.

After several attempts to reorganize the club, Solon Featherston bought the entire club, made many improvements (first bent-grass greens in North Texas), and brought the facility back to profitability–due in part to slot machines installed during his tenure.The layout features a good mixture of holes, with a creek winding its way through the course and coming into play on more than half of the holes. A small lake also impacts a few holes. The fairways are tree-lined and there is a moderate amount of bunkering. While some tee shots require the precision for target golf, others are wide-open and offer generous landing areas.In late 1994, holes 14 and 15 were renovated.

Created with the aim of obtaining a major championship, the course opened in 2002 in an amazing spot just 6 miles southeast of downtown in old Oak Cliff.The land itself was once owned by a cement company that was unable to effectively use the land, and the city of Dallas refused to zone the area because of an escarpment that slices the landscape. Result: the perfect opportunity to use the terrain for golf. But this isn’t just your normal run-of-the-mill upscale daily-fee development. The big boys play here--guys like Tom Hicks and Roger Staubach--and the price tag is rumored to be upwards of $160,000 to become one of 350 members.The high price tag, Fazio name, superb location, and stunning landscape combine to make one of the highest-profile facilities that has ever graced the great state of Texas. Dallasites would be shocked to learn of the spectacular elevation changes that reside so close to their flat city. Tipping out at over 7,300 yards, the par 72 track spreads out over almost 400 acres of limestone canyons, winding creek beds, and large plateaus, with up to 160 feet of elevation changes.Every hole is a signature hole, with Fazio’s signature bunkers defining the immaculate zoysia fairways. The natural appearance of the course is accentuated by the subtle reddish-tan cart paths, and artistic wooden bridges span the limestone ravines. Many holes offer elevated tees and impressive views of the city.And while the USGA gave the course one of the highest slope ratings ever (155), which is sure to help the club attract a big-time tournament, wealthy hacks can enjoy themselves from one of the other six remaining sets of tees.Getting there : Just east of Loop 12 between Keeneland Pkwy. and Jefferson Blvd. south of I-30.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/22677,,,,,,

It's an easily walkable layout that will appeal to players of all skill levels. It's a golf course where low handicappers can work on their skills in a no-pressure environment and high handicappers will be put to the test.

Though it's a military golf course, it's open to the public but don't forget to check in with security at the visitor's center. The layout features well manicured fairways lined with mature trees and challenging rough. The small greens demand accuracy and are made even more difficult with strategically placed bunkers framing the edges. There are some tough doglegs that require conservative play, and water hazards come into play as well. Whispering Firs Golf Club will test a variety of skills but it's not an overly punishing course.

Sunland is known for its plush fairways and well manicured greens. The layout can be challenging if hitting straight isn't your strong suit.

Rolling fairways are lined with mature Evergreen trees and the large, fast greens make pin placement a challenge. The front nine is fairly tight but the golf course opens up on the back nine.

Couples clearly favors traditional golf designs, as this one is pure old-school. A whopping six sets of tees allow just about anyone to enjoy the game at this exclusive club.The front side features the most difficult rated hole-the 473-yard No. 7, which tees over water and involves a tricky approach into a green protected by water left and back. The fairway snakes on No. 7, which creates some deceptive angles from which to approach the hole.On the back, Couples mixed it up well by offering an easier stretch of golf on holes 13-16, which consist of two relatively short par 4s and a pair of reasonable par 3s.Getting there : Take Beltway 8 south from I-10 to Westheimer.

The championship layout incorporates the plentiful water and woods of the natural terrain. The white sand bunkers that are strategically placed throughout add a beautiful contrast to the lush green of the golf course. The undulating terrain is one of the layout's most prominent features. Elaborate hills and greenside swales protect many of the putting complexes. The putting surfaces on the front nine are relatively calm when compared to the back nine where most of the greens are double-tiered, ridged, or layered. The par-4 15th is one of Stonebridge Golf Club's most scenic and challenging holes. With water in front, back, and right of the green, this is one of the toughest approaches on the back nine.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15148,,,,,,

The course has also been recognized as one of the 50 best public golf values in the country. The gently rolling hills of the landscape provide the course with rolling, tree-lined fairways and large, undulating greens, which are framed by strategically placed bunkers. Riverside is a challenging course but not so difficult that beginners should be intimidated. The classic layout is quite forgiving and versatile enough for a range of skill levels, one reason why it is the host to the Ray Fischer Tournament, one of the Midwest's most prestigious amateur events.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1708,,,,,,

It is scenic, challenging, well maintained and isn't as busy as most courses in Northern Utah.The reason that the course is not as busy is that it is a little more than an hour away from Salt Lake City and there isn't an Interstate running to it. But with the highway construction happening now in the city you can probably drive to Wolf Creek faster than you can across town.Wolf Creek is located in the rolling hills just below the canyon that leads to the Powder Mountain Ski Resort. The high mountains surround everything in sight and the area is very scenic. In addition to the golf course Wolf Creek includes condos and time share units for summer and winter vacationers.The course is a mountain style course with elevated tees, sloped terrain and lots of wild areas in which to lose your ball. Wildlife is often seen on the course including deer, moose and fox. A more common critter on the course is the garter snake. They are harmless but can give you a scare if you disturb one hiding hiding in the long grass.Wolf Creek is probably one of the top five toughest courses in Utah. It's tough because of it's playing length, not it's actual length. On the card, the tee lengths of 6845 (gold) and 6465 (blue) don't seem to be outrageous, but the way the holes use the yardage will make you think a 300 yard drive is required to score well.Several of the toughest par 4 holes in Utah are on Wolf Creek. Numbers 3, 7 and 18 are well over 400 yards long and each has an up sloping fairway to an elevated green. Long uphill second shots put fairway woods into the hands of all but the longest players. And once you reach the greens in regulation you still have to putt out on fast greens that break severely toward the valley bottom.Other long holes include the par 3s. All but one of them is in the 180+ range and two of them have long carries over water. The par 5s are the most manageable holes but even they have elevated greens making the holes play longer.The fairways are generally wider on the holes that require long tee shots, but all holes have plenty of places that provide lost and unplayable lies. The front 9 seems to be wide open as there are very few trees, but the long meadow grasses off the fairways will hide a ball as well as the thick woods on the back 9.Be cautious when driving from the elevated tees. Since the ball flies further after being hit from high above the landing area, the distance a miss-hit shot draws or fades will be exaggerated and you could end up missing the fairway. This is especially true on holes 1 and 10.Wolf Creek Golf Course is a tough challenge for the best golfers without being overly penal for mid handicap golfers. Beginners may find it over powering. Although the green fees are about $5 more than the average public course, Wolf Creek Golf resort offers a great value for the experienced golfer.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12779,,,,,,

The club is named after the four ancient oak trees that stood on the site when construction of the courses began in the 1960s. Unfortunately only one has been able to withstand the test of time, and golfers get a chance to admire this 450-year old tree on the second fairway of one of the golf course's nines.

The course is player friendly enough for beginners at a manageable 6,640 yards from the back tees, but the many water hazards and strategically placed sand traps that you'll encounter make it enough of a challenge to appeal to more advanced players. The long fairways demand accuracy but it's not an overly punishing layout off of the tees. It's a golf course that is as scenic as it is challenging with each hole offering a different setting. In addition to the golf course, Prince George has one of the most extensive practice facilities in the area, featuring chipping and putting areas where you can work on your short game and a driving range.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12986,,,,,,

There are some good opportunities to build up your score before facing the tougher back nine. It's a tighter layout with more trees, demanding accuracy and careful course management. A stream meanders through the golf course, connecting to the ponds that also come into play, especially on the back nine. There are also several strategically placed bunkers that lurk along the greensides. The golf course has some challenging holes but it's player friendly enough for beginners to approach with confidence.

The club gets its name from the land's former use, a raspberry field. The scenic terrain overlooks to Catoctin Mountains and there are still a few raspberry bushes dotting the course. By far the layout's most formidable challenges come from the deep, stacked pot bunkers that make it truly feel like a classic Scottish golf course. There are also water hazards on a few holes. The course's signature is the par-4 third hole, which is long but plays downhill all the way. The 10th hole, another par 4, is one of the toughest. The landing area is generous off the tee but there is a creek and pond to the left and fairway bunkers on the right.",http://www.raspberryfalls.com/,,,,,,

The Cottage, Lake, and Road nines come with enough variety to offer something for players of all skill levels from low handicappers to more experienced players. The green fees are applicable the whole day, which allows golfers to play all three courses if they have the time and the inclination. The Cottage/Road combination only has water on one hole, but it is a memorable one. The hole is Cottage's par 3 third, which is the golf course's signature. There is not only a formidable pond along the right but also an 8-foot bunker on the left.

Tremendous emphasis is placed on accuracy on this golf course, but it is not too punishing if your shots are slightly errant. The course stretches to 6,800 yards from the back tees.

The classic layout is more challenging than what you would expect from a traditional golf course from that era. It demands accuracy as well as skillful course management but it is a fair test that is still player-friendly enough for beginners to approach with confidence.

The front nine plays across rolling hills while the back nine is centered upon the manmade Lake Wisconsin. The bunkering throughout the golf course is minimal, but it is strategic and fair. The small, fast greens have enough undulations to give them some character but they are not overly difficult though the tricky doglegs shaped by stands of mature trees will test your accuracy. The par-3 12th hole is the signature thanks to a challenging island tee.

The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole.

At only 6,300 yards from the back tees, it is shorter than most modern championship golf courses but don't let the yardage fool you. This course will test you on even its shortest holes. Every hole features either out-of-bounds or a lateral water hazard on one or both sides.

Major golf publications including Golf Digest have hailed Castlegar as one of the best courses to play in Canada, especially for the value. The layout's most challenging hole is the par-4 ninth, which requires not only two long shots in order to reach the green, but the approach also has to be well placed to even have a chance at a birdie or par.

Several of the original buildings from the estate are protected and are still in use today.Possessing a variety of challenges over its eighteen fairways, the first three holes are fairly open and introduce you gently to this lush, park-like course. Difficulty arises quickly from the fourth tee box, where a rather narrow landing area awaits big hitters, with water on the left and out of bounds on the right. Laying up with a long iron is the sensible play here. The middle holes wind through fir and cedar-lined fairways, with a variety of doglegs and ponds to keep you focused. The par five fourteenth at 509 yards from the whites is a challenge not to be taken lightly. Lined by lakes on both sides, with a huge pot bunker guarding the green, you’ll do well to make par here. The 403-yard seventeenth is also a test with its undulating fairways and slippery four-tiered green.After your round, be sure to visit the historic clubhouse, 9,000 square feet and built from hand-hewn logs.

The golf course is equally challenging as it is scenic with dramatic bunkering and an abundance of trees and water features that come into play throughout.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/26360,,,,,,

The lake merges with a canal that leads to Lake Moultrie. The Player Course is routed through the different neighborhoods and it is joined by the Wyboo Golf Club in the adjacent community of Deercreek Plantation. The 18-hole golf course stretches to just over 6,900 yards from the back tees. It is a great course for long hitters but it also forces golfers to employ creative strategies on each hole. The layout is tight in some spots and thanks to the interconnected lakes, water hazards come into play on several holes. It is a golf course that will make you think but at the same time it is playable for a range of different skill levels.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12253,,,,,,

Opened in 1956, the 18-hole course has a traditional layout that is shorter than most modern courses. Despite the relatively short length, there are plenty of challenges in store on this golf course. The greens are severely sloped and they play lightning fast. More often than not, you'll find that they're flanked by strategically placed bunkers as well. There are also water hazards that come into play on several holes. The golf course appeals to a wide range of skill levels since it's not overly punishing for high handicappers and there are risk-reward opportunities for more advanced players. Woodlawn Golf Club is one of the area's most affordable and there's also a college and high school discount.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/7333,,,,,,

Jones reshaped all of the course's greens, creating several with multiple tiers, and he also rebuilt many of the tees, which are all now square. The fairways and greenside bunkers were completely reconstructed as well to provide a greater challenge. The signature hole is the par-4 16th, which poses a formidable threat since it plays right into prevailing wind.

The layout is considered one of the toughest in the province. The elevation changes throughout the course offer scenic mountain views but they also guarantee that a flat lie will be hard to find.

It is not often played or heard of because the club is reputed to be one of the most exclusive in the country. The golf course is laid across the east slope of Mount Bruno. The tree-lined fairways and heavily bunkered greens carefully follow the natural undulation of the landscape, featuring a good amount of elevation changes that often cause the ball the break in a different direction than what you're expecting. Mount Bruno's signature hole is the par-4 13th, which sits at the highest point on the course, offering a spectacular view of the surrounding valley. The tee shot plays downhill and then requires an uphill approach to an elevated green that slopes to the left and is flanked by bunkers on the right.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/28300,,,,,,

And while it’s part of a gated, active-adult residential community, the course is open to the public and especially fun because it integrates well with the neighborhood. Houses line some fairways, but a fair number of holes provide that natural, rural feel that is always so welcome on a golf course.While the course is not particularly demanding off the tees, the real challenge at Heritage Ranch comes from the mound-shaped greens. If your irons aren’t dialed in, you’ll be working hard for ups and downs.No. 1 is a unique opener because it bends left down to a fairway and green that aren’t visible from the tee. Big drives can get close, but the recommended play is to take a long iron and draw it over the hill.The par 5s on the front are nice holes. No. 3 doglegs right and requires a good tee shot, followed by a relatively easy second shot into a widening fairway toward the hole. The trick is nailing the short iron (almost a blind shot) into the elevated green guarded by bunkers on the front. No. 7 is longer and offers a good chance for birdie, again because of its wide-open nature.No. 16 is the signature hole: a par 3 masterpiece that plays along a natural spring waterfall. You’ll need to nail a long iron over the valley and avoid the trees that overhang the fairway from the right.No. 18 is a good finisher–it’s a long par 4 that doglegs left around a few large fairway bunkers, then works its way uphill to an elevated, mound-shaped green surrounded by bunkers. Ups and downs are possible here if you miss the green back left, which is easy to do when you approach with a fairway wood.Getting there : Only 20 miles northeast of Dallas, take I-75 north to the Stacy Road exit, then turn right and drive to the dead end. The road jogs to the left, then right, and continues as Stacy Road. The entrance is 2 miles down on the left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/22891,,,,,,

Situated in Fort Erie, Frenchman's Creek wanders through the gently undulating landscape of the nine-hole, par-36 course. Don't let the scenic tranquility or the length of the layout fool you though, the layout offers a formidable round. The most challenging feature of the golf course lies in the size of the small greens, which demand accuracy on the approach. The creek comes into play on a few holes and there are also a number of strategically placed bunkers throughout.

The front nine has remained largely unaltered over the years, but the back nine that was added later enhanced the course with several challenging elements. The contrast between the player-friendly front nine and the tougher back nine make for an interesting round.

The bunkers were rebuilt and re-sanded and the fairways were re-conditioned. Bear Creek G.C. has always been known for its excellent greens, which have a reputation for being some of the state's finest putting surfaces.

Surrounded by trees and bunkers, the small greens demand accuracy. It may be a short layout, but this formidable golf course requires careful course management, proper club selection, and solid short game skills.

The DGV Golf & Nature certificate in silver confirms this success.A varied round of golf awaits you on a course that will give you a lot of pleasure, but also requires a tactical game.We hope you have a great game!",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/31043,,,,,,

Past the beautiful things, you walk along the oak grove to the clubhouse - in true half-timbered style.A friendly welcome, perhaps a quick purchase in the pro shop, and then you can start your round. The precise allocation of starting times - even during the week - means there is no crowding at the tee.After a few strokes on the driving range and a few skillful chips and putts, you head to the first tee. You get a first impression of the course at tee 1: a dogleg to the right over meadows means that many a short tiger line drive disappears among the Heidschnucken. Precise play is required across the entire course, scattered drives quickly end up in the dense forest, in the numerous bunkers and lakes. A course that is certainly difficult; played tactically, however, it is an absolute must for every golfer. Add to that the beautiful heath landscape through which the 18 completely differently designed holes with their well-kept fairways and greens run. After the game, you can relax wonderfully on the club terrace with a view of the course. Anyone who wants to can join one another at the long tables. The boss is also always up for a chat. He is happy to talk about the beginnings at the club, the daily maintenance of the course or give tips for your own game.A successful day of golf is coming to an end - a shame, actually, some holes could certainly have been played differently...",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/31322,,,,,,

So that averages to one home every 30 years. The math is a little fuzzy, though, because the club has been at Pitfirrane since 1953.The current golf course was designed by architect J.R. Stutt. He played loose with the length, giving Dunfermline five par 5s and five par 3s, an unusual combo that gives the golf course lots of variety from hole to hole. In fact, on the front nine, no par is repeated twice, a streak that isn't broken until No. 10, which starts a string of three par 4s.The most taxing stretch, unless you have a booming driver, has to be the final five holes, start at No. 14, called ""West Lodge,"" a 381-yard par 4. You have to drive left to avoid a big tree on the right. The green is surrounded by trees also. No. 15 is a 479-yard par 5 called The Pentlands.

Located just north of Placerville, its location sits 3,000 feet above the fog line but still below the snow line, providing the ideal setting and perfect conditions for a round of golf. The golf course opened in 1965 but it was completely redesigned in 1994. The player-friendly course is gentle enough for beginners and while it may not be formidable, more advanced players still enjoy it for a quick, casual round. Camino Heights is an affordable round too, which gives it appeal for players of all skill levels. There are subtle-but-tricky contours that provide most of the challenges, but there are strategically placed bunkers around some of the greens as well.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3641,,,,,,
