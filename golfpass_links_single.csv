Feather River Park Resort,https://www.golfpass.com/courses/3616-feather-river-park-resort/,"Nestled in the heart of the High Sierras at an elevation of 4,300 feet, Feather River Park Resort's nine-hole golf course offers stunning views of meadows, canyons, and dozens of lakes that are scattered throughout the rustic countryside of the Mohawk Valley. Sand and grass bunkers complement the strategic mounding across the gently rolling landscape of the course, making ball placement a top priority in scoring well. This wooded golf course has pine trees lining its fairways and a water hazard coming into play. For avid golfers, Feather River Park Resort provides a challenging practice round for the two championship 18-hole courses that are nearby.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3616
