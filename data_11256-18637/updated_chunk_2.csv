Particularly the 405 yard No. 11, where a creek cuts into the fairway twice, framing the landing area off the tee. No. 3 is also tough, playing 446 yards and forcing another carry of a creek that cuts into the fairway. The 17th is another solid par 4–not as long, but picturesque because the green is completely surrounded by water.Finally, the feature that rounds out the experience at Wildflower is the great condition of the course, enhanced by the new irrigation system that keeps the fairways lush and the greens healthy and rolling true.Getting there : From I-35 north, exit Midway Drive and turn left.

12077,Panama Country Club,"Panama Country Club is situated on the Intracoastal Waterway along the Gulf of Mexico. Donald Ross designed the golf course in 1927. Eight of the holes still reflect his original work. The fairways range in size from narrow to medium width and they are strategically routed through the natural features of the environment, not only preserving them but also allowing them to come into play. The course is mostly flat, making it pleasant to walk, but there are a few subtle contours that provide a challenging element to the layout. A number of holes also feature water hazards. The small greens play fast, indicative of the era in which they were built. Panama Country Club's greens are in consistently good condition year-round thanks to a 2005 resurfacing project.",https://panamacountryclub.com/,,,,,,
