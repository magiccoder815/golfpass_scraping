5746,Sweetwater Country Club(Cypress Course at Sweetwater Country Club ),"Roger Packard came to Texas from Chicago in the early 80s to build what was originally three 9-hole tracks built for the LPGA and their Hall of Fame. Packard returned in 1990 to add a fourth nine, leaving the course with two 18-hole layouts.Both are short courses that put a premium on accuracy. The Pecan Course is a more traditional and longer than the Cypress Course, with water in play on 12 holes. The Cypress Course features more mounding in the fairways.Getting there : From Hwy. 59 south, take the Sweetwater Blvd exit and turn left. When you come to Palm Royale Blvd., turn right and drive a short distance to the course. The entrance is on the left.",https://www.swcclub.com/,,,,,,
5747,Sulphur Springs Country Club,"Sulphur Springs C.C. is a short, semi-private track whose small greens require precision approach shots. The front nine is the easier of the two sides and offers plenty of birdie chances, including two short par 3s and a pair of par 5s that play under 500 yards.The Billy Martindale-designed back features water on six of nine holes. The highlight is No. 18, a 335- yard par 4 that features water along the right side, including a portion that necks into the fairway at about 150 yards from the tee.Getting there : From I-30 going east, take Exit 127 and go 3 miles down the access road. The course is on the right side of the road.",https://www.sulphurspringscc.com/,,,,,,
5750,Sweetwater Country Club,"Sweetwater’s 18-hole semi-private country club course does not require length, as the middle tees play under 6,000 yards. Built on gently rolling terrain, the course features tree-lined fairways, water hazards that impact a few holes, and small Champion Bermuda greens that were installed in the mid-1990s.The toughest hole is the par 4, 425-yard No. 8. However many of the other par 4s are well under 400 yards. Not only are there birdie opportunities on the short par 4s, but all of the par 3s are under 200 yards, three of which should require no more than a medium-length iron. Hit the greens on the par 3s and you’re assured of a respectable round.Getting there : From I-20 west, exit Sweetwater Business and turn left on East Broadway. When you come to Hailey turn right, then proceed down to Woodruff. Turn (? ) and this road leads directly to the course.",,,,,,,
5751,T-Bar Country Club,"Built in the late 1950s, the semi-private T-Bar is a flat course with minimal trees, so the wind bears down hard. Hole 6 is the signature at 411 yards, featuring a tee shot is into a narrow landing area. No. 7 is also difficult and requires some nifty short game work. The bent-grass greens are in nice shape and hold shots well. As you might expect, the fairways are firm and the grass can get bare in some areas. Overall, a fun course to play because of its open layout.Getting there : Turn west off of Hwy. 87 and take Hwy. 380 until you come to T-Bar Lane. Drive north 2 miles to the course.",,,,,,,
5753,Wildflower Country Club,"Wildflower opened in 1987, and is one of Leon Howard’s better designs, featuring outstanding views of the central Texas landscapes, loads of water, and some of the best holes in this part of the state. While Howard established a reputation for basic, down-and-dirty courses in the 60s and 70s, this modern, challenging track is more of a complete golf experience.The design incorporates numerous water hazards, including many natural ponds that grace the rolling terrain. The fairways are fairly generous, and most of the greens have deceptive undulations.During the round you’ll notice the long, challenging par 4s. Particularly the 405 yard No. 11, where a creek cuts into the fairway twice, framing the landing area off the tee. No. 3 is also tough, playing 446 yards and forcing another carry of a creek that cuts into the fairway. The 17th is another solid par 4–not as long, but picturesque because the green is completely surrounded by water.Finally, the feature that rounds out the experience at Wildflower is the great condition of the course, enhanced by the new irrigation system that keeps the fairways lush and the greens healthy and rolling true.Getting there : From I-35 north, exit Midway Drive and turn left. Drive approximately 2 miles and turn right on Wildflower Lane.",https://www.invitedclubs.com/clubs/wildflower-country-club,,,,,,
5754,"Tribute Golf Club & Resort, The","The Tribute Course is one of two golf courses at the Otsego Club. With its other course, the Classic, Otsego was the first of what is now Gaylord's golf mecca. Added in 2001, the Tribute is the newer of the two but it has quickly made a name for itself. In addition to being a challenge, the course also offers picturesque scenery on almost every hole. There is very little water on the golf course but the layout doesn't need it with its variety of elevation changes and numerous strategically placed sand bunkers situated along the greensides and fairways. The course demands accuracy and length, making it a formidable test for even seasoned players but players of all skill levels will enjoy the unrivaled scenery regardless of their score. The third hole is one of the most scenic holes in northern Michigan, and it also provides a great birdie opportunity.",https://www.otsegoclub.com/,,,,,,

5760,Westwood Shores Country Club,"The track here along Lake Livingston weaves around eight man-made lakes, with holes that roll through skinny, pine-tree lined fairways routing to averaged-sized greens.The par 5s stand out for their length, one on each side. No. 8 is ranked number two in terms of difficulty, but plays 590 yards, while the toughest hole is No. 12 at a mere 569 yards.Getting there : From I-45 north, take Hwy. 19 towards Trinity.

5762,Tule Lake Golf Club,"Tule Lake is another small-town High Plains course with wide-open fairways and only a few hazards that affect play. This basic layout has a good variety of holes, with the standard two par 3s, two par 5s, and five par 4s. The longest hole is the 524-yard par 5 2nd hole, and the number one handicap is the 412-yard hole 6.Two sets of tees can be used when playing an 18-hole round. Pay once and play all day.Getting there : About 3 miles northeast of Downtown Tulia, take Love Rd. east for 1 mile, then turn north onto the County Road and drive a short distance to the course.",,,,,,,
5763,Willow Brook Country Club,"Willowbrook dates back to the 1950s, when Ralph Plummer came through to put his mark on Tyler golf. In 1980, Joe Finger came along for a redesign of this hilly, tree-lined course.The design features fairways of average width, water on only a few holes, and fairly prominent bunkering. Play it smart and take an extra club on most approaches because of the elevated greens.The most difficult hole is the 500-yard No. 16, a par 5 that forces two carries over water hazards and a green that is covered by bunkers.Getting there : From I-20, take Hwy. 69 south, then turn right on Loop 323. Turn left on Hwy. 64 to reach the course.",https://www.wbcctyler.com/,,,,,,

5767,Waller Country Club,"Jimmy Demaret laid this one out in the early 1970s, and his jewel of a design features the ubiquitous pine trees as well as a winding creek, two lakes, and a few small ponds that impact play.Sandwiched between two 530-yard par 5s are three par 3s and four par 4s. The par 3s are considered the easiest holes on the course; however, one goes 223 yards. The par 4s play just under 400 yards, including the number one handicap at 370 yards.Other notes: Walk-ons are welcome here, as it never takes too much time to get on the course.

5773,Wharton Country Club,"The WCC upgraded in the late 1990s by renovating their bunkers and greens. The terrain is varied here, with numerous ravines and creeks that come into play.Three par 3s are highlights of the round, mostly because they are all reasonably short and definite birdie opportunities. The toughest hole is the par 4 No. 3 at 429 yards, but every other par 4 is under 400 yards and both par 5s are reachable in two.Two sets of tees make for an 18-hole round.Getting there : Take Hwy. 59 south out of Houston and exit Wharton. Drive south and look for Boling Hwy. Turn left and drive to Alabama Rd., where you'll turn right and drive to Hwy. 60. Turn left on 60 and travel 1 mile to Old lane City Hwy. 1.

5774,White Bluff Resort(The New Course at White Bluff Resort),,,,,,,,
5776,Wichita Falls Country Club,"Fred Cooper, a Scottish immigrant, failed to find a suitable place to pursue his passion for golf when he settled in Wichita Falls in the early 1900s. So in 1914, the Wichita Falls Golf Club was formed with a 9-hole course and clubhouse on Victory Street.The club prospered through the 1920s, then fell on hard times during the Depression and was eventually turned over to the mortgage company in 1935. After several attempts to reorganize the club, Solon Featherston bought the entire club, made many improvements (first bent-grass greens in North Texas), and brought the facility back to profitability–due in part to slot machines installed during his tenure.The layout features a good mixture of holes, with a creek winding its way through the course and coming into play on more than half of the holes. A small lake also impacts a few holes. The fairways are tree-lined and there is a moderate amount of bunkering. While some tee shots require the precision for target golf, others are wide-open and offer generous landing areas.In late 1994, holes 14 and 15 were renovated. Jeff Brauer and Ralph Plummer have done work here periodically over the years.Make note of Ladies Day on Thursdays, as only ladies may tee off until 11:00 AM.Getting there : From Hwy 287 north, turn right at Midwestern, then drive 2 miles to the course. The entrance is on the right side of the street.",https://www.wichitafallscc.com/,,,,,,
5777,Texas National Golf Club,"Referred to as “the best piece of land left in America close to a downtown” by architect Tom Fazio, ultra-exclusive Dallas National sets a new standard for golf in Dallas. Created with the aim of obtaining a major championship, the course opened in 2002 in an amazing spot just 6 miles southeast of downtown in old Oak Cliff.The land itself was once owned by a cement company that was unable to effectively use the land, and the city of Dallas refused to zone the area because of an escarpment that slices the landscape. Result: the perfect opportunity to use the terrain for golf. But this isn’t just your normal run-of-the-mill upscale daily-fee development. The big boys play here--guys like Tom Hicks and Roger Staubach--and the price tag is rumored to be upwards of $160,000 to become one of 350 members.The high price tag, Fazio name, superb location, and stunning landscape combine to make one of the highest-profile facilities that has ever graced the great state of Texas. Dallasites would be shocked to learn of the spectacular elevation changes that reside so close to their flat city. Tipping out at over 7,300 yards, the par 72 track spreads out over almost 400 acres of limestone canyons, winding creek beds, and large plateaus, with up to 160 feet of elevation changes.Every hole is a signature hole, with Fazio’s signature bunkers defining the immaculate zoysia fairways. The natural appearance of the course is accentuated by the subtle reddish-tan cart paths, and artistic wooden bridges span the limestone ravines. Many holes offer elevated tees and impressive views of the city.And while the USGA gave the course one of the highest slope ratings ever (155), which is sure to help the club attract a big-time tournament, wealthy hacks can enjoy themselves from one of the other six remaining sets of tees.Getting there : Just east of Loop 12 between Keeneland Pkwy. and Jefferson Blvd. south of I-30.",https://www.dallasnationalgolfclub.com/,,,,,,
5778,Squaw Creek Golf Club,"Ralph Plummer built this in the early 1970s for employees of the Lockheed Martin plant, but today Squaw Creek is open to the public. Its namesake creek runs through the property, and the course is popular because of its sloping, bermuda grass greens. Walkers might have a rough go of it, as the terrain is fairly rugged and there are significant elevation changes.Playing from the tips, you’ll face quite a few 400-yard-plus par 4s, and a pair of par 3s that are over 200 yards. The number one handicap is the 595-yard No. 16.Getting there : From I-30 west, take the 418 exit and turn right on Ranch House Rd. The entrance is on the left side of the road.",https://www.squaw-creek.com/,,,,,,
5779,Windcrest Golf Club,"Formerly a private club, Windcrest Golf Club is now open for public play. This nine-hole course is tight in some spots with a traditional layout that calls for a variety of different shots. Tree-lined fairways and elevated greens protected by bunkers require sharp short game skills and accurate placement off the tees. Water hazards also come into play on two holes. With four sets of tees, the golf course is perfect for juniors and beginners who want some practice or avid golfers wanting a quick round. One of the most appealing things about Windcrest Golf Club is that it doesn't get especially crowded on weekends, meaning tee times are rarely required.",http://www.windcrestgolfclub.com/,,,,,,
5780,Webb Hill Country Club,"Funeral home man and golf fan Bobby Owens led the development of Webb Hill CC in 1969, and the Leon Howard-designed 18-hole course has served Wolfe City ever since. This course is heavily wooded, with narrow, undulating fairways and a good combination of interesting tee shots. Howard’s design involves a few blind tee shots that play uphill, as well as a few from elevated tees that offer good views of the holes ahead. Water comes into play on half the holes, and the large greens are of medium speed.No. 8 is the signature, playing 590 yards and requiring two tough shots down a swerving fairway lined by a lake. The approach is nasty because of the skinny green that is covered by trees.Getting there : From I-30 east towards Greenville, take Hwy. 34 north to FM 2358. Turn left and the course is just down the road on the right side.",https://www.webbhillcountryclub.com/,,,,,,
