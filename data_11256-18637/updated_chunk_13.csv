18182,Great Hills Golf Club,"Great Hills rests atop one of the highest points in the Hill Country, featuring a Don January and Billy Martindale design that rolls through scenic hills and canyons.Updates in 1990 lengthened the course, but it still plays a pedestrian 6,103 from the white tees. During the renovation, the last three holes of the more spectacular back nine were modified.No. 16 is deceptively tough, playing only 378 yards but highlighted by huge oak trees and a hilly, rolling fairway before you get to the green. No. 17 is the most scenic par 3 on the course, a 183-yarder. And the par 5 No. 18 is one of the more welcome finishing holes that you’ll come across, a definite birdie opportunity at only 477 yards.Getting there: From Highway 183 north, take the Great Hills Trails exit and turn left.

18190,Gulf Winds Golf Course,"On the grounds of the Naval Air Station, this military facility started out as a rudimentary 6-hole course that opened in 1955 and eventually became a first-class 18-hole layout. Prior to the final expansion in 1985, the course had 12 holes, with hackers playing six of the holes twice for a full round of golf.The military personnel, some of whom maintain the course in exchange for green fees, keep this simple track in excellent condition. The course has forgiving, wide-open fairways-if your approaches are accurate into the small greens, only a true butcher could three-putt. Two ponds and a creek impact play on six holes. At only 5,700 yards, the course is very susceptible to low scores without the wind.Hole 18 is a good finisher, playing 420 yards into the wind with out-of-bounds looming left.Getting there : From I-37 south exit South Padre Island Dr. and turn onto NAS Drive.

18302,"Links At Land's End, The","Although the Links at Land's End has a location that is seemingly remote, many golfers have deemed it worthy of the trek to Yantis. The challenging round is coupled with a scenic and secluded location along the banks of Lake Fork. You won't see much water on the early holes, which play among mature trees, but it has a prominent presence on the golf course starting with the fourth hole. It's a layout that demands accuracy with tall grass and trees lining the holes in addition to the water hazards and strategically placed bunkers. The stretch of holes from the sixth through the 12th is situated right on the lake, making you feel almost as though you're playing on an island. They offer the best views on the golf course.

You'll probably want to leave your camera behind because there's nothing really too picturesque about this golf course. The tees are slightly elevated and there is no water.

Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur.

This monster doglegs left inside a cliff that runs along the right side. Out-of-bounds is left, and a fairway bunker resides about a lob wedge from the narrow green, which is bolstered from behind by more bunkers.No. 18 is one of the more interesting finishing holes that you’ll come across, featuring two dogleg fairways, one right and one left, that both involve dealing with the creek that splits the two routes. The tee shot right is more favorable, since it is void of fairway bunkers like the ones on the left side.

The signature is perhaps the 213-yard No. 16, which tees through a chute of trees down a fairway lined by water on the left.Getting there : From Hwy 635 east, take the Preston Rd. exit and turn left.

18402,Oak Hills Country Club,"""Oak Hills is classic golf architecture at its finest,"" says Carl Bielstein, La Cantera's director of golf, about Oak Hills Country Club's heritage and its noted architect, A.W. Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984.

When the wind blows the course can play difficult, but with only a smattering of water hazards, it's not too tough.The signature hole is the 215-yard par 3 No. 9. The long shot into the shallow green is challenging, and the swale in the green makes it hard to hold. Other feature holes here are the 560-yard No. 7 that seems to always play into the wind. Off the tee you'll see water right and out-of-bounds left, with a narrow landing area.

18448,Pedernales Country Club,"“Willie’s Course” is officially called the Pedernales Country Club, but “Cut ‘N Putt” is also printed on the scorecard. This rugged, almost pasture-golf-like course is known for its superb greens, goes 3,330 yards, and despite its lack of formal hazards, is extremely challenging unless you’ve played it a few times.The old sand bunkers have been covered by sprawling Bermuda. The fairways are hard–sometimes solid tee shots will roll and roll until they find the Hill Country scrub that lines the fairways.Holes 4 and 7 have water. The fourth is notable because it requires a perfectly placed mid-iron into the dogleg-left fairway with water on the left, followed by an uphill approach over the drink to the green. They call the 7th hole the signature: the elevated tee offers one of the course’s best views, and you’ll have to deal with a severely sloping fairway that cuts right and requires another perfect tee shot to avoid having your ball slip off into oblivion.Suffice it to say, this is required golf for any true Texan who dabbles in the great game. It’s Willie’s course and it’s public. You can choose to play by his “cowboy-Zen” rules and save yourself a few strokes. Heck, he might even join you if he’s on the premises.Other notes: Charles Howard built the course and Willie took it over in 1979.

18471,Preston Trail Golf Club,"What makes this one of the best golf courses in the state? Let’s list the reasons: Location: Far north Dallas, with White Rock Creek meandering through. Layout: Stunning and traditional, with tree-lined fairways, the right amount of water and bunkering, and huge, lightning-fast bent-grass greens. Feel: Cart paths run the way they should--from greens to tees, not the other way around. And caddies are always available to promote playing the game on foot. Mystique: Memorabilia of professional tour players who are also members is tastefully distributed throughout the clubhouse, and the shrine to Mickey Mantle (a longtime member) is awe-inspiring. You’ll need serious connections to play this course, but here are some highlights.The third hole is a 591-yard par 5 with a narrow tee shot that opens to a wide landing area. The homes lining the right side of the fairway no doubt shelter some of the most jealous people in the world. The second shot begins to run down the dramatic slope that ends in a huge green in front of the creek.The next par 5, the 498 yard 6th, has a similar slope which begins in the landing area of your drive. If you really pop it and have the wind, you’ll be at the base of the hill with about 175 yards left to the large, two-tiered green. Be careful, though–it’s protected by dense woods on the left and back, and water on the front and right.The 7th hole is the number one handicap. This 422-yard par 4 dogleg right requires a perfectly faded and long tee shot to get far enough into the throat to approach. You’ll still be hitting a long iron or wood into the severely back-to-front sloped green, and good luck making the putt from above the hole.The back nine is maybe the best anywhere, but two holes stand out above the rest. The 16th is a 428-yard par 4 with a slight dogleg left. The tee shot is elevated at least 100 yards above where the green sits. A big, high draw will put you about 150 yards away from the two-tiered green, which is protected by the creek in front. They really like to put the pin on the lower tier right in front of the creek, which gives you about 20 square yards to work with. It’s a lay-up hole for all but the longest and bravest.The 422-yard dogleg-right finishing hole is almost a mirror of the 16th–it’s a long dogleg right, all uphill. The tee area is extremely narrow from the tips, and the fairway slopes to the left to make shaving the corner as hard as possible. This ends up being a 5 par for most, and the outcome of many Nassaus is changed on this hole.It’s hard to describe this course without gushing, not to mention that hearing about it just frustrates most people because they won’t have a chance to see it for themselves. But keep your eyes and ears open for friends who may be members and schmooze them as much as possible–it will surely be worth the effort.The details : 972-380-0669. 17201 Preston Trail Dr., Dallas, TX 752481965.

Palm trees and tropical vegetation provide problems and out-of-bounds is always a factor, since the course sometimes routes between houses.Hole 3 is one of the most difficult, a 440-yard dogleg left with water affecting both the drive and the approach. No. 14 is a long par 5 that doglegs twice around a lake, and the par 3 No. 16 plays 224 yards from the tips. The tee shot on 16 carries 120 yards of what was once part of the Rio Grande River.

The layout also features a ditch that comes into play on five holes, and a water hazard that impacts Nos. 6 and 7.The only par 5 is the short 455-yard No. 3. Most of the holes are of standard length. The most difficult is the 375-yard No. 6, although some argue that the next hole, a 211-yard par 3, is actually the toughest test of golf.Getting there : From Hwy 77 north, drive through Refugio 2 miles.

Jay Morrish renovated the course in 1988. Hole 2 is guarded on the left by the Trinity River and is long at 450 yards. Number 10 is loaded with hazards–a lake guards the landing area that runs all the way to the back of the green. Drive it well on number 12, where the river weaves across the fairway three times.

18501,River Bend Resort & Country Club,"Set along the Rio Grande River, this is a scenic course with spectacular views. The front nine was built in 1987, and the back nine followed in 1992. The highlight of the course is what is perhaps the longest water hazard in Texas, the Rio Grande River, which flows along holes 5 through 13 on the left side of the fairway.Narrow fairways and grass bunkers make the course tough, especially when the wind is howling, as it is tough to hit the small, firm greens. Water is everywhere. No. 14 is the only hole without water. The par 3 17th hole, with its island greens, headlines a series of demanding par 3 holes. The last hole plays 434 yards into the wind and has out-of-bounds on either side of the fairway.Getting there : From Harlingen take Hwy. 77 south.

18504,River Oaks Country Club,"River Oaks isn't the oldest, but it's definitely one of the preeminent names in Houston golf. Dating back to 1925 when Houston was hardly exposed to the game of golf, Philadelphian Jack Burke Sr. became the first head pro, no long before Sam Snead and Ben Hogan began coming to the club to work on their game. A new generation of golfers like Jimmy Demaret and Claude Harmon, Sr. (Butch's dad) came along, and River Oaks earned a reputation as the hub of Houston golf.Designed by the legendary Donald Ross, River Oaks is a timeless, traditional layout that is one of the most exclusive in the country. The high-dollar real estate that Ross had to work with was small, but covered with stately old oak trees and ancient pines all nestled along the banks of Buffalo Bayou.The layout features some of the area's best short holes-distance isn't an issue, but accuracy is imperative. In addition to the oaks and pines, the skinny fairways are lined with azaleas, magnolias, and dogwoods. The greens are small, slick, and make for challenging targets.Other notes: Joe Finger came along in 1967 to initiate improvements of the greens, tees, and the rerouting of a few holes.Getting there : From I-45 south take the Hwy. 610 exit west and find Westheimer Rd.

Located on the former Wilding Ranch between Lake Austin and Ranch Road 620, the Hill Country terrain is phenomenal, with a creek that dominates the front nine, and some dramatic slopes that never result in level lies.The sloping is evident on No. 1, a 402-yard par 4 that requires a testy approach over a ravine from a downhill lie. No. 4 is tough because the creek rolls along the left side of the 561-yard hole before crossing in front of the green. And No. 7 is one of the toughest: a 430-yard doglegger that bends right around the creek.The back side has a few ponds that come into play, but is void of the pesky creek. The one to watch for is No. 17, a 585-yard monster.Getting there : From Loop 360, take Ranch Rd 2222 going west..

18512,Riverhill Country Club,"Riverhill’s architect, Joe Finger, is a well-traveled Renaissance man who has dabbled in everything from corrugated plastics and dairy farming to college golf and course development. So it says something that he chose Riverhill Country Club as his home. Consistently rated as one of the top courses in all of Texas, Riverhill is a scenic layout with major elevation changes; undulating, elevated greens; lots of water and tough Hill Country brush that wreaks havoc on errant balls.Leon Howard designed the course originally as a 9-hole layout back in 1952, but members eventually commissioned Byron Nelson and Ralph Plummer to improve the layout. Plummer became ill, opening the door for Finger’s contributions. One of his most challenging holes is No. 11, a par 3 that sometimes plays around 200 yards from the tips. With the wind blowing and water on all along the right side, it’s an intimidating tee shot when you’re aiming at the tiny green.Hole 4 is the most difficult rated hole, a 458-yard par 4. Another tough challenge is the long par 5 14th, which happens to be proceeded by another long par 5, creating a tough stretch of golf on the back side.Getting there : From I-10 west, take Hwy. 16 south.
