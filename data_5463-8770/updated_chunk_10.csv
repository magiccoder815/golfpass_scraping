7195,Ledgeview Golf & Country Club,"Ledgeview Golf & Country Club sits on the scenic north side of Sumas Mountain. The course offers panoramic views of the valley to the west and the Coast Mountains to the north. Its hilly location provides plenty of elevation changes throughout the course. Golfers will be hard-pressed to find a flat lie anywhere on the layout. The golf course is covered with towering trees, which come into play often. There are water hazards and strategically placed bunkers throughout as well. Ledgeview's signature hole is the challenging eighth, which the club claims to be one of the best par 3s in all of BC. It is a tricky downhill hole that plays to a narrow green protected by sand. Trees border the entire length of the hole along the left side and a pond treacherously waits to the right.",https://ledgeviewgolf.com/,,,,,,

7211,Cottonwood Golf Course,"Cottonwood Golf Course is still a relatively young course with the first nine holes being completed in 1995 and then being joined by the second nine in 1998, but it has quickly built a loyal following thanks to the excellent green conditions and the extremely affordable rates. Several lakes and streams come into play throughout the golf course and sparsely, but strategically placed bunkers add another element of challenge. The course opens with a tricky par 4. The slight dogleg requires a drive to the middle left of the fairway in order to avoid the water hazards that flank the right side. Its green is large and forgiving but there is sand both in front and behind. Golfers can play either a full round of just nine holes from a variety of different tee boxes, making Cottonwood Golf Course accessible to players of all skill levels.",https://cottonwoodgolfcourse.com/,,,,,,
7212,Castlegar Golf Club,"From its perch atop a plateau that sits above the Columbia River, Castlegar Golf Club offers spectacular views of the surrounding mountains. The up-and-down layout plays through forests of pine trees that can prove to be treacherous to the errant shot and the sloping greens don't make the golf course any easier either. Major golf publications including Golf Digest have hailed Castlegar as one of the best courses to play in Canada, especially for the value. The layout's most challenging hole is the par-4 ninth, which requires not only two long shots in order to reach the green, but the approach also has to be well placed to even have a chance at a birdie or par. In addition to the challenging course, a driving range and practice greens are also available for golfers at Castlegar Golf Club.",https://golfcastlegar.com/,,,,,,

7231,Sunnydale Golf & Country Club,"Sunnydale Golf & Country Club can trace its roots back to 1923 but the 18-hole course that exists today did not come to be until 1983 when a second nine was added. During its remodeling as an full-length layout, the greens were seeded, irrigation was improved on each hole, and hundreds of trees were planted. The golf course has matured nicely into a player-friendly layout that appeals to all skill levels. The layout features flat, tree-lined fairways and small greens that are sparsely but strategically bunkered. There are also some greens that are dome-shaped to watch out for. Water hazards come into play on several holes throughout Sunnydale Golf & Country Club. Between the ninth and 18th fairways there is a practice area golfers can use that features two putting greens.",https://www.sunnydalegolf.ca/,,,,,,
