The course is like playing two in one with a front nine that is spacious and open while the back nine is much tighter and more heavily tree lined. The entire Wedgewood layout sprawls across gentle undulating terrain, providing subtle breaks throughout that will test your skills. There are two holes that are particularly memorable, the 13th, one of the toughest par 4s in the area, and the 17th, a tough par 5. The 13th is a lengthy par 4 that requires a second shot over water with a long club to a difficult target.

Not with the fast greens, dramatic elevation changes and swerving fairways available at Oak Valley in Beaumont.A Lee Schmidt and Brian Curley design, Oak Valley is probably best known for greens that are anything but desert typical. Speed is the name of the game here, with a tap sometimes too much on a downhill putt.Recognition does not travel that quickly. It took a decade for Oak Valley to get a four star rating from Golf Digest. Once it did, Beaumont suddenly became a golf stopping spot on the Palm Springs express. Now, you're considered a smart golfer if you linger on the way to Palm Springs.""It's a nice getaway from the crowds in the desert, as well as some of the other, more populated golf areas,"" head pro Scott Arnold said. ""It's almost like being in the country. No houses line the fairways. Each hole is different.

Elaborate hills and greenside swales protect many of the putting complexes. The putting surfaces on the front nine are relatively calm when compared to the back nine where most of the greens are double-tiered, ridged, or layered.

In addition to the course, Olde Fort has a driving range as well as chipping and putting greens for golfers to use.

2660,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

Generous landing areas offer some room for error off of the tee and the greens are large and inviting. There are still plenty of trees and sand traps to keep the layout interesting though. Accuracy and careful pin placement are also required to handle Wildwood Green's subtle elevation changes. The golf course finishes with one of its most difficult holes.

2704,North Shore Country Club,"North Shore Country Club sits along the Intracoastal Waterway, offering holes that play along the ocean as well as some that play inland weaving through coastal marshes and towering pines. The golf course blends seamlessly with the scenic surroundings. Strategically placed bunkers fiercely protect the greens and golfers should also be prepared for some tricky forced carries. The fairways are generous and forgiving though. The course is a fair test but it is especially tough on windy days. The interior, tree-lined holes contrast nicely with the waterfront holes and they have the added benefit of protection from the prevailing sea breezes. North Shore Country Club is a player-friendly layout that both beginners and seasoned players can enjoy, which is why it has become one of the Outer Banks' most popular golfing destinations.",https://www.northshoregolfcoursenc.com/,,,,,,

2714,Players Club at St. James Plantation,"The Players Club is one of four championship courses at St. James Plantation. There are a total of 81 holes since the Members Course has a nine-hole extension. Each golf course has a different designer, including P.B. Dye and Hale Irwin, but they all share the same stunning landscape. The natural wetlands and vegetation were carefully preserved, earning all four courses certification as Audubon Cooperative Sanctuaries. The Players Club was designed by North Carolina native Tim Cate. It stands out from the other courses thanks to its stunning views of the rolling Carolina countryside. The challenging layout is quite memorable too with narrow fairways that demand accuracy and numerous waste bunkers strategically placed throughout. There is also a smattering of coastal Carolina hardwoods that can be tricky to maneuver.",https://www.theclubsatstjames.com/,,,,,,
2715,South Harbour Golf Links,"Located between Wilmington and Myrtle Beach, Oak Island Par-3 Golf Course at South Harbour at South Harbour is the first par-3, executive golf course on South Brunswick Island. The course sits on the Intracoastal Waterway, offering scenic ocean views and a stunning coastal landscape. The nine-hole layout is gentle enough for beginners but it is great for a fun, quick round regardless of skill level. The course is an enjoyable walk with houses providing a backdrop to the lush fairways and manicured greens. Water hazards come into play on a few holes and there are also a few strategically placed bunkers lurking beside the greens. Advanced players looking for a test won't find it here but the golf course is great for mixed groups or for getting in some quick practice.",http://www.oakislandparthreesouthharbour.com/,,,,,,

2718,North Carolina National Golf Club,"The three different nines at Carolina National Golf Club are named after the birds that inhabit the acres of beautiful low country that the course sits on. Fred Coupes designed the 27-hole layout, taking care to preserve the beautiful natural landscape and wildlife provided by its location on the shores of the Lockwood Folly River. His work earned the golf course designation as an Audubon Sanctuary. The nines: Ibis, Egret, and Heron; all have different challenges. However, they all have challenging greens that boast some of the best conditions in the area. The Ibis is the most player-friendly of the nines. Carolina National Golf Club's 27-hole layout is played as three different 18-hole combinations. The Ibis offers some opportunities to recover your score since it is not quite as long as either the Egret or Heron.",http://www.carolinanationalgolf.com/,,,,,,

The Yadkin Valley stretches east from the Blue Ridge Mountains across the rolling hills of the North Carolina Piedmont. Like many golf courses in the area, Yadkin is routed up and down rolling terrain and through mature trees. The layout is challenging with an interesting mix of holes, none of which run parallel to each other. The par 3s are long and there are a few reachable par 5s. The par 4s will make you think, requiring thoughtful drives and approaches. Strategically placed bunkers and mounding lurk throughout and water hazards come into play on a few holes. Yadkin Country Club is a tough but fair layout that emphasizes strategy over strength.",https://www.yadkincountryclub.com/,,,,,,

It has a few challenges in store but overall it is a player-friendly course that beginners can approach with confidence. The layout has a wide open front nine before it moves onto hillier, more wooded terrain. The first nine holes are more forgiving than the back nine, allowing some room for error off the tees. The back nine is a scenic round of holes, sprawling across gently rolling hills studded with mature trees. There are also some challenging par 3s that require a carry over water. Sedgewood Country Club is a diverse golf course that is approachable for all skill levels and made even more accommodating thanks to three different sets of tees.",,,,,,,
