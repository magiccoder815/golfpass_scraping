4147,Greencastle Greens Golf Club,"Greencastle Golf Club covers more than 200 acres of lush, rolling countryside studded with mature trees and tranquil ponds. The winding layout has many doglegs and incorporates a variety of elevation changes. Golfers should be prepared for a fair amount of blind shots as well as uneven lies. The spacious golf course has several holes that will please long hitters, but this layout will test your accuracy and course-management skills too. Water comes into play most memorably on Greencastle's signature third hole where there is a man-made waterfall and fountain but the par-4 10th is the toughest. This hole has an island green that is cut in half by a large drop in elevation, a good test for the two following holes which are not any less challenging.",https://greencastlegolf.com/,,,,,,

4167,Colonial Country Club,"Colonial Country Club, located in Fort Worth on the southern banks of the Trinity River and near TCU, is one of the most historic golf clubs in Texas. The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times. Other multiple winners of this longstanding PGA Tour event include Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Nick Price and Ben Crenshaw.",https://www.colonialgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings.

There are many challenges throughout the golf course including deep rough, expansive wetlands, eight ponds, and sloped greens that are often tiered.

Nicklaus utilized the natural features of the site including the lakes and streams, rolling terrain, and abundant wetlands.

All of the holes were carefully carved from the surrounding woodlands and molded into the hillsides. An abundance of trees characterizes the course, giving all of the holes a secluded feel that is further enhanced by the design, which doesn't feature any parallel fairways. The Trail/Blue Course combines the shortest and longest nines but both are considered slightly more challenging than the Ridge nine. The Trail nine possesses two of the four water holes at the club.

The heathlands layout feels like a links course with wind being an important factor and thick fescue coming into play. The golf course starts with an especially tough front nine but there are more scoring opportunities on the back. Mounded bunkers and moguls define the movement of the fairways and though there aren't many trees, if you don't keep your shots straight you might find yourself out-of-bounds or lost in the high, wiry grass. Sidehill lies await you as well as a few blind shots. Wyncote's greens have little undulation but the lightning fast putting surfaces are a challenge for players of all skill levels.

The East Course, the original layout, has hosted a number of legendary players, including Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead, since 1912.

The golf course is known for its playability but there are several challenges in store that will test your shot-making skills. The course starts out mildly with a front nine that sprawls across gently undulating meadows while the back nine gets hillier and more challenging. There are more lakes and strategically placed bunkers that come into play on the back as well as a hidden brook that is just waiting for errant shots. Regent's Glen's 11th hole is one of the most intimidating, with a large lake along the fairway. If you dare to carry a portion of this hazard, you'll be rewarded with a shorter approach to the flagstick, however the hidden brook and deep bunker in front of the green will make that very difficult. You'll have to choose your strategy carefully and proper club selection is also key.",https://www.regentsglen.com/,,,,,,

4574,Portage Country Club,"Portage Country Club is situated along the scenic shores of Swan Lake. Opened in 1930, the golf course has a traditional layout that is both challenging and playable. At 6,356 yards from the back tees, it is shorter than most championship courses you will find today but the layout still has plenty to offer besides length. There is a mix of holes that are wide-open and some that are framed by stands of mature trees. The rolling terrain provides subtle but tricky undulations in the greens and fairways as well as the occasional double-tiered green. One of the most memorable holes for both its level of difficulty and the scenery is the par-4 third. This no. 1 handicap hole plays along the lake and forces you to keep a close eye on the target.",https://portagecc.net/,,,,,,

It is the first course in New England to be certified as an Audubon International Cooperative Signature. Golfers can enjoy spectacular views from every hole. Named after the Red Tail Hawks that soar above the golf course, the landscape offers classic New England golf with maple trees, birches, oaks, and pines. There are also tall grasses and sand along the fairways and greens, providing a few elements of coastal courses. The Red Tail layout offers a great amount of variety thanks to the diverse landscape. There is an interesting mix of risk-reward opportunities and link-style touches throughout the course.

4608,Country Club Of The North,"Country Club of the North was designed by legendary golfer and Ohio native Jack Nicklaus. The layout is definitely indicative of his style and it is considered one of southern Ohio's ""must-play"" courses. The layout has demanding approach shots balanced by generous landing areas, one of Nicklaus' trademark features. His unwavering dedication to preserving the natural landscapes he works with is also apparent in the unspoiled beauty of the terrain. Hundreds of mature trees cover the golf course, which extends beyond 7,000 yards from the tips. The fairways twist around a series of lakes and streams and the subtly contoured greens can also be tricky. There are numerous bunkers strategically placed to create additional risk-reward options on every hole.

4610,Sugar Valley Country Club,"Sugar Valley Country Club in Bellbrook is one of the area's most affordable country clubs. Surrounded by idyllic countryside, the golf course offers a serene atmosphere and a beautiful landscape that is ideal for golf. Although the yardage indicates the course as being a seemingly short 6,511 yards, the layout tends to play much longer due to the hilly terrain and narrow fairways lined with mature trees. The greens putt true and fast but they are known for their massive size. There are some that measure in at over 10,000 square feet. Proper placement is the key to this demanding layout. Hitting a strategic spot on the landing areas will require apt club choice off of the tee.

The wide-open front nine is reminiscent of traditional Scottish links courses with undulating mounds and sweeping fescue grasses. The heavily wooded back nine presents an entirely different challenge. Drawing more from the style of classic American courses, the back nine has a dramatic rolling landscape blanketed with trees, which often come into play along the fairways. From the blustery fairways on the front nine to the narrows fairways of the back as well as the large, fast greens throughout, Jefferson Golf & Country Club demands accuracy from start to finish.
