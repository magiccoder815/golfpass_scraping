5958,Whispering Firs Golf Club,"Whispering Firs Golf Club is one of two courses operated by Joint Base Lewis McChord. The other course, Eagles Pride, is located southwest of Whispering Firs. Designed by Bob Baldock in 1962, Whispering Firs opened on what was then McChord Air Force Base and later became part of Joint Base Lewis McChord. Though it's a military golf course, it's open to the public but don't forget to check in with security at the visitor's center. The layout features well manicured fairways lined with mature trees and challenging rough. The small greens demand accuracy and are made even more difficult with strategically placed bunkers framing the edges. There are some tough doglegs that require conservative play, and water hazards come into play as well. Whispering Firs Golf Club will test a variety of skills but it's not an overly punishing course. Players of all skill levels will be able to enjoy a round here.",https://jblm.armymwr.com/,,,,,,

6043,SunLand Golf @ Country Club,"Sunland Golf and Country Club in Sequim, Washington weaves through an elegant retirement community. Originally opened as a nine-hole course in 1971, the second nine was added a few years later and in 2009, the course opened its doors to the public. The layout was designed by A.V. Macan, who contributed several notable courses throughout the Pacific Northwest including Firecrest in Tacoma and Broadmoor in Seattle. Sunland is known for its plush fairways and well manicured greens. The layout can be challenging if hitting straight isn't your strong suit. The landing areas are quite narrow with homes and cedar trees throughout the course. In addition to the golf course, Sunland also boasts one of the best practice facilities on the Olympic Peninsula, which includes an expansive outdoor driving range with grass tees.",https://sunlandgolf.com/,,,,,,

6087,Alderbrook Golf Club,"Alderbrook Golf & Yacht Club is consistently ranked as one of the top 25 courses in the Pacific Northwest. The course is known for being one of the most scenic in Washington as well as one of the most playable. Though it's member owned, it's open to the public. Throughout the course you'll enjoy incredible views of the Hood Canal and Olympic Mountains. The layout is challenging but fair, offering a test of your skills without being overly punishing. Rolling fairways are lined with mature Evergreen trees and the large, fast greens make pin placement a challenge. The front nine is fairly tight but the golf course opens up on the back nine. Alderbrook's final hole is the layout's most memorable. Scoring par on this double-dogleg par 5 is something to be very proud of.",https://alderbrookgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

6094,Royal Oaks Country Club,"The Royal Oaks CC serves up an unparalleled Fred Couples signature course that tips out to a 7,007-yard, par 72, highlighted by the superb features of the country's finest golf clubs: tall Texas pines, scenic waterfalls, undulating, multi-level greens, and even a few island holes. Couples clearly favors traditional golf designs, as this one is pure old-school. A whopping six sets of tees allow just about anyone to enjoy the game at this exclusive club.The front side features the most difficult rated hole-the 473-yard No. 7, which tees over water and involves a tricky approach into a green protected by water left and back. The fairway snakes on No. 7, which creates some deceptive angles from which to approach the hole.On the back, Couples mixed it up well by offering an easier stretch of golf on holes 13-16, which consist of two relatively short par 4s and a pair of reasonable par 3s.Getting there : Take Beltway 8 south from I-10 to Westheimer. Turn right and drive to Rosemary Park Ln., where you'll turn left into the club.",https://www.royaloakscc.com/,,,,,,
