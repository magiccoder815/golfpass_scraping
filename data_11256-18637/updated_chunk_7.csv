The golf course also enjoys panoramic views of the Sacramento Valley. Massive rock outcroppings border the fairways, calling for some creative shot making. Accuracy is also a necessity with meandering creeks and bunkers coming into play on most holes. The layout is challenging but five sets of tees make the golf course approachable for a variety of skill levels. Winchester G.C. is not only well known throughout northern California, it has also been ranked as one of the 15 best in the state.",https://www.winchestercountryclub.com/,,,,,,

They persevered with their idea and eventually established an 18-hole, par-72 course right in Cumberland Center. The golf course has a traditional layout that is heavily lined with trees. Accuracy is an important part of the round but if you can manage to hit straight, you'll have a good game. Strategically placed bunkers also lurk along the greensides and fairways. In addition to the golf course, there is a driving range and practice green. Val Halla Golf & Recreation Center is a scenic and more affordable alternative to other options in Portland.",https://www.cumberlandmaine.com/,,,,,,

14706,Hillcrest Golf Club,"Alvin's second country club opened in the 1960s, built by a man named Shorty Plaster who wanted to make the most of his land investment. Shorty was a hacker and his short course is designed to accommodate the lesser golfer with its executive-like 2,385-yard length.Plaster's design opens up with three par 3s, followed by another on No. 5. Every par 4 plays 350 yards or less, and the sole par 5 is only 475 yards. Not many non-par-3 9-holers are blessed with lights, but this one is. The same goes for the driving range, so you can definitely spend some hours at this nice little country course.Getting there : From I-45 south, exit Dixie Farm Rd. and turn right. Drive 8 miles to where it dead-ends, then turn on Hwy 35. Drive 8 miles to Fairway Dr. and turn left.",https://www.hillcrestnightgolf.com/,,,,,,

The gentle start offered by the front nine is nicely balanced with the more challenging back nine. Be sure to build up your score on the player-friendly first half because greater accuracy will be required for the final stretch of the golf course. With plenty of variety among all of the holes, the layout will test your skill with different types of shots. There are a variety of elevation changes ranging from subtle to dramatic, providing tricky uphill and downhill lies. The contours are complemented by strategically placed bunkers that lurk along the challenging greens. Water hazards also come into play on several holes at Cape Neddick Country Club.",https://www.capeneddickgolf.com/,,,,,,

14716,Penobscot Valley Country Club,"Opened in 1924, Penobscot Valley Country Club in Orono, known locally as ""Penobby,"" has a classic design created by Donald Ross. Nestled in the rolling hills of central Main, the golf course runs alongside the river that created its namesake valley. The scenic landscape is covered with mature trees, which are concentrated along the undulating fairways. The original design was slightly tweaked in 2001 to make it both more challenging and more playable. The green sizes were reduced and bunkers were shifted or removed. The result was a golf course that is challenging enough for more advanced players but still gentle enough for beginners to approach with confidence. The classic elements of Ross' design still manage to shine though, which has cemented Penobscot Valley Country Club's status as a Maine tradition.",https://penobscotvalleycc.com/,,,,,,

Having two different designers gives the golf course plenty of variety, especially since the holes are intermingles. Cornish's greens are bigger and flatter while the Ross holes feature some of his characteristic greens and bunkers. Water hazards come into play as well and you'll face a few tricky doglegs and blind shots. There are some challenging holes but overall it's not an overly difficult golf course. The average player can still approach it with confidence. With a secluded location in rural western Massachusetts, Ellinwood Country Club offers beautiful views of the surrounding countryside. The 11th hole, with a winding brook that runs alongside the fairway before cutting in front of the green, is particularly scenic.",https://www.ellinwoodgolf.com/,,,,,,

14907,Marshfield Country Club,"Opened in 1923, Marshfield Country Club was one of the first golf courses in the area. There have been many changes over the years, including opening to the public in 1965 and the addition of another nine holes in 1974. At just over 6,000 yards, it's a short course by modern standards but it's no pushover. The greens are known for being challenging and they are also some of the truest and smoothest putting surfaces you'll find in the area. Though length may not be required, accuracy and course management are essential. The hazards at Marshfield C.C. are mostly provided by the existing landscape, including the meandering creeks, mature trees, and rocky outcroppings, which are complemented by several strategically placed bunkers. Each hole offers a different test, beginning with a tough par 4. This dogleg left hole has a stream that cuts right through the center.",http://www.golfmarshfieldcountryclub.com/,,,,,,

14962,Bay Pointe Country Club,"Bay Pointe Country Club was known as Wareham Country Club when it first opened in 1964 up until 1988 when it underwent a major renovation, including the construction of the island green seventh hole, which is the golf course's signature. The club underwent yet another multi-million dollar renovation in 2012 when the club changed ownership. In the most recent renovation, hundreds of extraneous trees were cleared from the fairways in order to get it back into pristine condition. Although it's a seemingly short layout at just over 6,200 yards from the back tees, it actually plays much longer. The first two holes are laid across the hilliest portion of the terrain. Though you have a challenging start, the rest of the Bay Pointe golf course eases into a gentler landscape.",https://baypointeclub.com/,,,,,,

14965,Kettle Brook Golf Club,"Located just outside of Worcester, Kettle Brook Golf Club is surrounded by the reservoir from which it got its name. It is one of the area's most popular public courses. The golf course sprawls across gently rolling terrain laced with mature trees and marshland. The greens are large, making accurate pin placement essential, and there are also subtle breaks that can be difficult to read. Water hazards and strategically placed bunkers also come into play but the more challenging elements are balanced by the player-friendly fairways are wide and forgiving. There are five sets of tees on the golf course, allowing golfers to play to their own abilities. Much of Kettle Brook Golf Club's challenges will depend on which tee box you choose but most golfers will find that they have to employ the use of every club in their bag.",https://www.kettlebrookgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

14974,Wentworth Hills Golf & Country Club,"Wentworth Hills Golf Club in Plainville, Mass. covers a scenic landscape that ranges from densely wooded hills to open, grassy meadows. The greens vary in size and shape from hole to hole, reflecting the diversity of the terrain. They were also carefully shaped and angled to make the approaches especially challenging. More than 60 bunkers are strategically placed throughout the golf course and water hazards come into play on several holes. The eighth and 17th holes are challenging twin par 3s that share a large lake. They present golfers with the decision to either go for the green or play it safe, but the latter will be met with a much trickier shot if you want to make par. Wentworth Hills G.C. is tough but four different tee boxes make the course approachable for every skill level.",https://www.wentworthhillsgc.com/lander,,,,,,
