This course really demands accuracy or you can put some big numbers on your scorecard.""Playing the forward tees will give resort golfers enough of a challenge to keep them happy, while better golfers will be heavily challenged from the tips, which play nearly 7,000 yards, with a slope of 136.",https://hiltonheadgolf.net/clubs/palmetto-hall,,,,,,
