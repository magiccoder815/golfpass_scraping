The rolling terrain also promises difficult uphill and downhill lies. Bunkers are strategically placed throughout and there is water on a few holes. A windy day adds yet another formidable element to the challenging design. The diverse layout has a mix of difficult par 3s, reachable par 5s, and a few birdie opportunities.

17826,Patriot Hills Golf Club,"Tucked away in the Ramapo Mountains on a perch overlooking the Hudson, Patriot Hills Golf Club in Stony Point feels far but it’s conveniently only an hour’s drive from the city. The golf course tumbles across dramatically rolling hills, providing views that span the Hudson Valley. Don’t let the 6,485 yards on the scorecard fool you, the daunting elevation changes make the course feel much longer. Walkers should be forewarned that this mountainous golf course is nearly impossible on foot. You can expect a few approaches to uphill greens but more often you’ll be faced with intimidating shots from elevated tees, which loom more than 200 feet above the severely contoured fairways below. The Patriot Hills layout is a formidable test but players of any skill level can appreciate the meticulous care that went into crafting each hole.",https://www.patriothillsgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

Robin Nelson designed the course in 2002. He utilized the gently undulating landscape to seamlessly connect the holes to one another so that the whole golf course has a natural flow. The front nine is gentler than the back, where the par 3s present formidable tests. The water hazards on the back are particularly challenging. The golf course finishes with one of its most memorable holes. Ravenwood's par-5 18th has a green that's tucked into the woods with the hill behind it forming a natural amphitheater. A challenging array of seven strategically placed bunkers guards the green and approach area.",https://www.ravenwoodgolf.com/,,,,,,
17840,Richland Country Club,"Richland Country Club's history dates to 1900, to a meeting at Maxwell House Hotel's Commercial Club to put together the Nashville Golf Club, which at the time had informal membership and no charter. There were some squabbles and some land leases and some best-laid plans that led nowhere and World War I, and it wasn't until the end of 1920 that Richland finally formed. The golf club bought the old Nashville Golf and Country Club's clubhouse and land for $22,500, leased an additional 92 acres on which to build an 18-hole golf course and enlisted the golf course architect Donald Ross to lay it all out.Of course, golfers at the Richland Country Club today are playing an all-new golf course in an all-new spot, this one a Jack Nicklaus Signature Golf Course that runs alongside the Granny White Park.After a round at the Richland Country Club, head back to the clubhouse and the Waxo Greene Grille for casual eats and sweet vistas of the golf course, not to mention a round around the fireplace.",https://www.richlandcc.com/,,,,,,

17900,Abernathy Country Club,"Like so many other small-town courses in the Panhandle, this “country club” is a 9-hole, semi-private course that allows anyone to play. With only one water hazard (hole 9), no bunkers, and flat terrain, this course is very fair, good for the ego, and fun for the high handicapper. This course is best experienced as a day trip from Lubbock.The fairways are lined with trees and sport rare mounds that result in an uneven lie. Both par 5s have dogleg fairways. The toughest hole is a 226-yard, par 3 into a green framed by mature trees; it’s particularly difficult when the winds are howling. Pay once and play all day. For the second round use the additional set of tees for a different look.Getting there : Exit FM 2060 off of I-27 and head east 4.5 miles to the course.",,,,,,,
17901,Abilene Country Club,"The par-70 Club Course at Abilene Country Club dates back to 1920, but was redesigned in 1993 by George Williams and Garrett Gill, who reconstructed 10 holes. Pro golfers such as Tommy Bolt, Charles Coody, Don Cherry, Mike Standly, and Bob Estes have all spent time here.The fairways are generous and the layout is loaded with bunkers. The track’s first hole of note is the beautiful 360-yard par 4 No. 5, which doglegs left. Locals aim at the three oaks on the right side of the fairway and work their draw. The most difficult hole is the 390-yard par 4 ninth hole, which plays uphill into the wind with an approach that must carry water. Hole 14 (190 yards) is also tough, requiring a long iron with the wind–which makes it impossible at times to hold the green, and is especially treacherous with water front and left of the green.Getting there : From I-20 west, exit 83/84 and take the Buffalo Gap exit. Turn left onto Industrial, then turn right when you come to Treadway. The course is on the right side of the street.",https://www.abilenecountryclub.com/,,,,,,

17911,Amarillo Country Club,"North of town lies the Amarillo Country Club, a private 18-hole layout that’s considered one of the best courses in the Panhandle. William McConnell designed the course way back in 1919, and renovations occurred in 1960 (Warren Cantrell), and again in 1983 (Jay Morrish).Tree-lined fairways, various hills, and several out-of-bounds make this a tough course, even though it’s relatively short and there are minimal water hazards. The course has a good variety of holes, with several par 4s over 400 yards and only three par 5s. The feature hole is No. 6, a 349-yard par 4 that requires an approach shot over a lake into a green surrounded by bunkers.Getting there : North of town on I-40 going west, take the Western Ave. exit and turn left. When you come to Bushland Rd., turn left; the entrance is on the right side of the road.",https://theamarillocountryclub.com/,,,,,,

Its back nine is the favorite-a challenging, tighter track with a better set of holes. The best hole is No. 15, a long, 430-yarder that involves water off the tee and a creek that impacts the approach on the left.Getting there : From Houston, take I-45 north to Hwy. 105. Drive west 9 miles to the course on the right.",https://www.invitedclubs.com/clubs/april-sound-country-club,,,,,,
17916,Archer City Country Club,"Defining the outskirts of town, with ranchland beyond the mesquite-lined fairways, this 9-hole, semi-private course has unquestionable character. Rusted iron ladders have been placed on the barbed-wire fences surrounding the course, enabling one to track down shots that somehow don’t find the fairway. The asphalt cart paths are cracked, the tee boxes are baked hard, and the bald Bermuda fairways shine like a bowling alley from the abuse of the sun and wind, enabling even the most incapable golfer to reach a par 5 in two.The track features medium-length par 4s and a small lake that comes into play on a few holes. There are a few elevation changes, but the course is mostly flat. The greens are simple to read, a bit quick, and in good condition. Best of all, the price is right and the people are friendly.Getting there : From Wichita Falls, take Texas 79 south to Archer City. Once in town look for the signs leading to the course.",http://www.archercitycc.com/,,,,,,
17919,Aspermont City Golf Course,"This 9-hole semi-private course opened for play in the early 1960s. The course is wide open, relatively easy, and perfect for the average player.

17921,Athens Country Club,"Athens Country Club is an 18-hole, semi-private course that dates back to the 1930s. On this short course (5,873 from the tips), you’ll have the chance to hit short irons into every par 3, and have birdie opportunities at all four par 5s that play well under 500 yards. The front nine allows more room for wild tee shots, as it’s more wide-open than the back. The feature hole is No. 13, a 427-yard par 4 highlighted by a blind approach shot to the green.Getting there : From I-20 drive east and take Hwy 19 south. Exit Athens Square, then drive west for one block and turn left on Prairieville Rd. At Park Lane turn right, and the course is just up the road.",https://athenscountryclub.org/,,,,,,
17922,Austin Country Club,"Back around 1900, when the greater Austin area was only home to about 25,000 residents, Harvard Law School graduate and lifetime Austinite Lewis Hancock organized one of Texas’ first formal country clubs, the venerable Austin Country Club.The first nine-hole course, now known as Hancock Park, featured sand greens and a tiny two-room framed clubhouse. The club stayed put for half a century, noted for the presence of Harvey Penick. Then after a huge local debate, the facility was moved to Riverside Drive in East Austin. From there it made it another 35 years before moving to its current Davenport Ranch location.The current ACC layout, designed by Pete Dye, rests on the shores of Lake Austin and the Colorado River. Dye didn’t veer from his usual method of creating an impressively difficult track using his trademark railroad ties, deep pot bunkers, and huge undulations.The opening holes play along Lake Austin, and are more of a links-style design. Afterwards the Hill Country takes effect, featuring canyons, ravines, creeks, and unbelievable views.The back nine features many outstanding holes, including the 446-yard No. 11, which deceptively doglegs left along a canyon before requiring an approach over that same deep ravine. The par 3 No. 16 also stands out, featuring a long carry over another canyon.",https://www.austincountryclub.com/,,,,,,
17923,Austin Golf Club,"Ultra old-school, the Austin Golf Club is just that: a golf club. No real estate, no country club amenities, just a spectacular course designed by Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore. The course, which opened in 2001, has slipped under the publicity radar and is an exclusive, quiet club that simply serves as a place to play for its members.While not much information is available for the course, AGC is unique because of its outstanding caddie program, and because it’s one of the only courses in the area with Zoysia tees, fairways, and first cut of rough. Perhaps we’ll be able work our way on in the future, but for now we can only drool over the lush bent-greens that Master Crenshaw created.Getting there : We’re not exactly sure because the location is somewhat secret, but you could take Texas 71 west out of Austin for about 20 miles, then tour the back roads around Spicewood toward the lake looking for an ocean of green, lush Zoysia grass.",,,,,,,
17925,Balcones Country Club -Balcones,"Originally located in a remote part of the Hill Country that has now been absorbed by the Austin city limits, the BCC dates back to 1956 when it was only a 9-hole layout. Today the club boasts two totally distinct tracks, known as the Balcones Course and the Spicewood Course.The original 9-holer transformed into the easier Balcones Course. With water on only two holes (15 and 16), it’s just a friendlier layout that is enjoyable also because it plays fast. The signature hole is No. 6, a 456-yard par 4 highlighted by a magnificent old oak tree in the fairway.Getting there : From I-35 north, take Highway 183 north and take a right on Hunter's Chase Road. Turn left, drive a little ways, and the course is on your left.",https://balconescountryclub.com/,,,,,,
17926,Ballinger Country Club,"This 9-hole, semi-private course (open to out-of-towners) features a small creek and mildly undulating terrain. The creek impacts two holes, and there is only one hole with bunkers. No. 2 is the signature hole, a 379-yard par 4 with a tee shot over a canyon and out-of-bounds on either side of the fairway. Nothing too fancy here–both par 3s are well under 200 yards.

17929,Barton Creek Resort -Fazio Canyons,"The newest addition to the Barton Creek golf mecca is known as The Canyons, a tipped out 7,153 yard, par-72 Tom Fazio masterpiece that is actually two miles from the resort’s clubhouse. Environmentally friendly like the other three tracks, this one was designated in the Certified Audubon Sanctuary System (one of the first in the country), which speaks to the level of care that went into preserving the natural environment.At Fazio’s disposal was the Short Springs Branch Creek, a scenic limestone bedded feature that rolls through the course, and enhances the oak and sycamore laden fairways. The views on this one are just as tremendous as the others, and the golf community has already heaped heavy praise for the Canyons, with Golfweek Magazine labeling it the #1 Course in Texas for 2002.The ender is the signature, a 561-yarder that might be the best finishing hole at Barton Creek. The most difficult hole finishes off the front side, a 457-yard par 4.",https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/austin-barton-creek,,,,,,
17932,Bay City Country Club,"Bay City's original course dates back to the 1930s-it lays out along the Colorado River with giant old oak trees lining the fairways. In addition to the river, another creek winds through the layout, keeping water in play on just about every hole.No. 6 is considered the signature not only for the stunning view of the countryside, but for its 185-yard poke over the water. The ender is tough as well, featuring trees along the left, the river on the right, and that pesky creek that fronts the green.Other notes: A tenth hole was added after the river temporarily swallowed No. 8. Walking is only allowed during the week.Getting there : From Hwy. 35, turn left on Latuelley, and the course is about a mile away.",https://www.facebook.com/baycity.countryclub.3,,,,,,

Another short par 4 and two par 3s follow, allowing the day to start right. Later on the front, the number one handicap 8th hole shows up, playing 520 yards and generally not reachable in two.The back nine consists of short par 4s and 3s and offers plenty of birdie opportunities.Getting there : From I-10 east, take Hwy. 69 north to Lucas, then drive east to Pine St. Turn left and the course is a short distance down the road.",https://www.beaumontcountryclub.com/,,,,,,

17946,Bellville Golf & Recreation Club,"Bellville offers a decent little 9-hole country course with wide-open fairways and small, mound-shaped greens that can be extremely tricky at times, depending on the condition. As with many small-town courses, the funds just are not available to maintain the course up to championship standards, so conditions vary depending on the weather. The trick here is to get used to the target greens and deal with the conditions-otherwise you might miss a few make-able putts. But we do that under the best of conditions, so does it really matter?One pond comes into play on holes 6 and 7. Despite the greens, the tee boxes and fairways are generally in good condition.Getting there : From I-10 east, take Hwy. 36 north to the course about 15 miles away",https://www.bellvillegolf.com/,,,,,,

17950,Bent Tree Country Club,"Located next to Dallas’ exclusive Preston Trail Golf Club, Bent Tree opened in 1974 as the centerpiece for a 700-acre development headed by Dallas real estate investors Robert Folsom and John Murchison. The two hired the eclectic Scotsman Desmond Muirhead to design the course on 190 acres of former cotton fields.In the 1980s, the LPGA and Senior PGA tours frequently hosted tournaments at Bent Tree, and the course was eventually renovated in 1990. The improvements focused on the front nine (which is still more open than the back), spicing up the layout with bunkering, tree additions, and adjustments to greens.Water comes into play on 14 of 18 holes, and the course is quite long if you play from the tips. The best hole on the front is No. 3, a long par 5 that plays almost 600 yards. The narrow fairway chutes between water on the left and bunkers on the right, and the small green slopes severely to the water on the left side.The more interesting back nine offers a nice stretch of golf on holes 13-15. No. 14 is the most scenic on the course because it plays downhill at least 75 feet to a green surrounded on three sides by water. The 387-yard 18th is the perfect finishing hole–not too long but plenty challenging.Getting there : From I-635 east, take the Dallas North Tollway and exit Westgrove.

17951,Bentwater Yacht & Country Club -Miller,"The Miller Course is quite different from Weiskopf's design. Architect Jack Miller, who worked as a designer under Jack Nicklaus for 10 years, bragged that the terrain ""is absolutely the finest piece of land I've ever been able to work on."" His parkland-style track features lush fairways, virtually no rough, pine needles sprinkled about the course, and Champion Bermuda greens that are surrounded by huge swales.No. 14 is bordered by the blue waters of Lake Conroe, and is annually selected as one of the best par 3s in Texas",https://www.bentwater.com/,,,,,,
17952,Bentwood Country Club,"Bentwood opened in 1979 and is an 18-hole private course laid out through a residential community. The course can be difficult when the wind is blowing, especially with its somewhat lengthy layout (almost 7,000 yards from the tips) and out-of-bounds on most holes. Four sets of tees provide options for every skill level. The fairways and roughs consist of the durable 419 Bermuda grass, and the large, undulating greens are Champion Dwarf Bermuda.The front nine gives you the chance to start well with several par 4s under 400 hundred yards, and a 523 yard par 5 that is a definite birdie opportunity when the wind is at your back.The feature hole is No. 8, which has out-of-bounds on the right and usually plays into the prevailing south wind. At 464 yards it plays more like a par 5, and starts a difficult stretch of golf that extends through the 13th hole. Holes 9 and 10 play just over 400 yards, with the latter a dogleg left with water on the right and out-of-bounds on the left. The approach on No. 10 is into an elevated green surrounded by bunkers. Eleven is a 517-yard par 5, followed by a monster par 3 (224 yards), and another relatively long par 4 No. 13 (420 yards).Getting there : Located on the southwest side of town off Loop 306.

Water is in play on 10 holes, including the tricky 326-yard 9th, where the tee shot needs to clear the first lake and the approach must carry another.The par 3 No. 12 is another beautiful hole. Your tee shot must slide through a narrow chute of trees and avoid the lake to the left of the skinny green.Getting there : From I-35 north, take Exit 266 and turn left.

There are no bunkers or water hazards. The course weaves in and out of a quaint housing community, and a few elevated tees offer views of Lake LBJ.Notable holes include the 365-yard par 4 with out-of-bounds looming left and trees on the right, and the par 3 16th, which plays almost 200 yards.Two sets of tees make for an 18-hole round, andyou can pay once and play all day.Getting there : From Hwy. 71 west, turn right on Blue Lake Deer Haven Dr., then drive 2 miles north to the course.",https://bluelakegolf.com/,,,,,,

The short course, void of bunkers, opens up with a nice, short par 3 that only requires a 9 iron at most. The remainder of the layout features short par 4s, and a series of back-to-back par 5s and par 3s on holes 4-8.The toughest hole, which is the longest par 4, is the 395-yard No. 3, but it’s followed by a 278-yard par 4.Two sets of tees allow for an 18-hole round.Getting there : From Loop 121 north, turn right on Russell Ave. From Hwy.78, turn left on Russell Ave.",,,,,,,
17966,Booker Country Club,"Unique in that it is the northernmost course in Texas, BCC is a nice little layout with a few trees lining wide fairways.

The greens are small, of average speed, and putt true.This 3,054-yard par 35 does not require length, but accuracy is important because of the overhanging trees. Water impacts play on two of the final three holes, and while the course starts out fairly wide open, you’ll soon learn to be aware of the impact of the trees.Getting there : From I-35, take Hwy. 22 west to Meridian.

The course features wide, tree-lined fairways and small greens, as well as water that comes into play on almost half of the holes.One local told us that short-iron play was important; however, that’s hard to imagine considering the length of some of the holes. Three holes stand out from the tips: Two par 5s play 600 yards or better (No. 11 is 643 yards), and No. 3, a 247-yard par 3.

The first is a 163-yarder into a green protected left by water and bunkers to the right.

The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times.

18062,Corpus Christi Country Club,"Big-name architects have left their mark on Corpus Christi Country Club over the years. Fred Mcleaod, then the winter professional at Maryland's Columbia Country Club, built the course in 1909, followed by a redesign at the hands of John Bredemus in 1921 and a rare visit by Robert Trent Jones in the mid-1960s. This beautiful links-style course offers open fairways and undulating greens where stiff winds can interfere with drives and cause high shots to blow wildly off course.When the 9-hole course originally opened on the high-toned North Beach, President William Howard Taft was in Texas to visit his brother, who owned a ranch across Nueces Bay. Taft participated in the opening ceremonies in front of the green wooden building which is distinguished by its white trim and veranda on all four sides.The course fell victim to the 1919 hurricane, and club members didn't reorganize until 1921. John Bredemus came down from Del Rio after the completion of the San Felipe Springs Country Club and immediately put crewmen to work clearing and grading for $1.50 a day. The fairways and greens were fertilized with cottonseed meal, and the first shot was fired on Labor Day, 1922. At the time, this course on the Texas Riviera was considered one of the finest in the country.At the end of the Depression, oil was discovered under the course and wells produced from 1936 to 1943, increasing revenues but creating some interesting man-made hazards in the layout. By 1938, the club expanded the course to 18 holes. The existing Robert Trent Jones design opened in 1964 on Everhart Road.Getting there : Exit the Crosstown Expressway off of I-37 and head south to South Padre Island Dr. Continue south and exit Everhart, then proceed for 3.5 miles to the course.

The men's tee also has a ladies' course rating of 76.9 and a slope of 136.Designed by A.W. Tillinghast in 1914 during his Texas swing, thus is a links-style course with tree-lined fairways built around a large lake. Amid the rolling hills and oak trees you’ll find few level lies.

With a rolling landscape provided by the scenic Hill Country, the Live Oak Course at Fair Oaks Ranch is named after the towering, mature trees that are spread across its hilly terrain. There are large, undulating greens and trees strategically lining the narrow fairways. Ponds and creeks come into play on a few holes and there are numerous strategically placed bunkers.

18129,Fairway Oaks Country Club,"Originally built in the 1970s by Ron Garl and Charles Coody, the club was purchased in the late 1990s and has been updated for the more modern game. Fairway is a long, challenging course that has hosted the Southwest Classic from 1981 to 1991. The layout incorporates many bunkers, and water dominates the back nine. In 1981 the LaJet Classic at Fairway Golf and Racquet Club was added to the PGA tour.The highlight of the course is the demanding nature of the finishing holes. Many a promising round has been tossed into the water that’s present on each of the last five finishing holes. Survive the carries on 14 and 15, and deal with the par 3 hole 16 with water on the left, and your confidence will be strong enough to deal with the 448-yard par 4 17th, which requires a tee shot of at least 200 yards to reach the fairway. From the blue tees the par 5 18th is only 485 yards, but the lake runs the entire length of the fairway waiting to eat any fade or slice.Getting there : From Hwy 83/84, exit Antilley Rd. and turn right.

18132,Farwell Country Club,"Farwell Country Club, an outstanding little course set in the middle of farm country, opened for play in the 1960s. The signature of this course is the large, undulating greens that are kept in perfect condition. The fairways are wide open and are lined by trees and a standard cut of rough. Although there are no sand bunkers, grass bunkers are scattered throughout and a lake comes into play on two holes. Two sets of tees make for an 18-hole round, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how differently the course plays on that second nine.Getting there : From Lubbock take Hwy. 84 west to Farwell.

The signature hole, the par-3 seventh, features a green that is surrounded by water on three sides and a spectacular view of the mountains. Flying L Guest Ranch Golf Course & Resort's back nine is less challenging than the front nine, but it has a few interesting surprises in store.

18139,Fort Clark Springs Golf Club,"Fort Clark Springs is a residential and resort community that offers a short 18-hole regulation course and a 9-hole par 3 course, both of which are open for public play. Las Moras Creek meanders through the picturesque community of about 750 households, and the population swells a bit during the winter as retirees move in and take advantage of the warm weather.One of the great features of this course is that it offers the chance to play from the tips and score very well, as the back tees are just over 5,700 yards. Most of the par 4s are barely over 300 yards, making length off the tee a non-issue. Only the par 4 No. 16 at 357 yards resembles anything close to what you might see back home. Hole 12 has some length at 566 yards, and is the number one handicap hole.Plan accordingly if you're in the area, as the course is very popular with the locals and can get very crowded. Call ahead.

The Salado del Rio course is the more scenic of the two, offering spectacular views of the rustic countryside. The historic facility boasts some famous players including Sam Snead and Arnold Palmer. The layout is also more difficult than the other championship course at the club due to the presence of numerous blind shots and water hazards.

18151,Gaines County Golf Course,"After you drive through this flat, barren region of cotton and oil production, you’ll be stunned when you stumble upon this hidden Panhandle gem that played host to Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer in a 1963 exhibition. Originally built as a 9-hole course by Jim Terry in 1953, the facility was updated with another nine holes in 1991.The layout features good elevation and plenty of trees, especially considering the terrain. The most outstanding amenity is the greens, which are large, fast, and in excellent condition. Sometimes the fairways dry out and the condition is average, but that helps the ball roll and is definitely beneficial when the wind is blowing.Every par 3 requires a long iron, but the demanding par 4s are the attention-getters. Two par 4s stand out among many that are above average in difficulty for courses in this remote area. The signature hole is No. 8: it’s only 340 yards but requires an approach shot over a pond to a well-bunkered green. Hole 5 also plays tough as a 435-yard dogleg right with an approach into an elevated green. This hole is particularly long into the wind.Getting there : Drive through Seminole north on Hwy. 385 and look for the signs to the course. The course is set in a large grove of trees on the left side of the highway.",https://www.facebook.com/gainescountygolf,,,,,,
18153,Galveston Country Club,"The original Galveston CC dates back to 1898 as a 9-hole track with a membership of only 30; however, the hurricane of 1900 wiped out the facility. The club moved back and forth between the island and the mainland in the early 1900s-it was once known as the Oleander Country Club around 1912 before moving back onto the beach in 1918. That location on 61st Street remained intact until 1946, when John Bredemus was asked to design the new, short, water-infested, wind-burdened layout that exists today.Ralph Plummer and Carlton Gipson had their hands in things over the years as developer George Mitchell obtained the facility's lease in exchange for promised long-term improvements.Today mature palms and oleanders line the fairways, and much like the old days, the modern version is known for precise shot-making. Solid course management is mandatory for scoring well.No. 7 is the most difficult, a 418-yarder that's lined by water on the left for the first half of the hole. Bogey is a good score when the wind is blowing. On the back side, the 180-yard No. 11 is a real treat. Virtually surrounded by water, the hole plays over the edge of the lake into a green framed by bunkers with water in the back.Getting there : From I-45 south, take the 61st St. exit, then drive to Sea Wall Blvd. Turn right and head down to 12 Mile Rd.

18157,Garden Valley Golf Resort -Dogwood,"The older Hummingbird Course, which has taken a back seat to the now-famous Dogwood Course, still offered some adequate golf even though the quality was not up to the standards of its more popular brethren. Highlighted by extreme elevation changes, the course’s signature hole was the 566-yard No. 2, which required two shots over a hill followed by a tricky approach back downhill to the green. Hummingbird course was closed recently and only the newer Dogwood course can be played.In 1992 John Sanford was blessed with some amazing terrain for the Dogwood Course addition. Cut out of the thick East Texas forest with 100-foot-plus tall pines, this course is most often compared to the famed Augusta National because of the abundant crape myrtle, Carolina jasmine, hollies, and dogwoods–not to mention the more than 1,500 azaleas that bloom beautifully in the spring.Although there are only two par 4s over 400 yards, the Dogwood is plenty difficult, playing to a 132 slope rating. Water is in play on 12 holes, the elevation changes are extremely confusing, and the bent-grass greens are lightning-fast.The regulars know that a good start is imperative because the first four holes are the easiest on the course–two short par 4s and two easy par 3s over water. You’ll need that momentum as the holes grow increasingly more difficult.The par 3 9th hole plays 212 yards with an intimidating body of water lurking left. Hole 11 features a lake to the left and behind the green. No. 13 is the most difficult, featuring a testy drive through the chute of trees off the tee and a massive lake that protects the green.Getting there : From I-20, take Hwy. 110 (Exit 548) south.

18160,Georgetown Country Club,"Georgetown Country Club is an old, private course, dating back to 1924 when it was a 9-hole layout. The second nine was added in the 1970s, and today the par 70 layout rolls through the San Gabriel River valley, with water coming into play on eleven holes.The old nine is more basic, taking advantage of the natural terrain without as many modern, man-made hazards.

Eldridge Miles, an old-school Dallas-area pro, once wrote to von Hagge that “I have played many of your courses and have always like your work; however, I believe the Gleneagles course represents some of the most creative, interesting, and challenging work that you have every produced.”The King’s Course is considered the favorite among members.

The facility moved to Pearland in 1965 and hired Joe Finger to rebuild the course in 1971.Finger moved a significant amount of dirt and integrated mounding and bunkering into the predominantly flat terrain. Lakes are placed throughout the design, coming into play on 13 holes, and the greens are extremely fast with sneaky undulations. The main trick to playing Golfcrest is dealing with the wind.Other notes: In 1932, Golfcrest experimented with night golf by installing floodlights on the front nine.Getting there : From Hwy. 288 south take Hwy. 18 east to Country Club Dr. Turn left, drive 1 mile to the course, and look for the entrance on the right side of the street.",https://www.golfcrestcountryclub.com/,,,,,,
