Boasting some of the best greens in the Tidewater area, the club offers the amenities of a private club with the fees of a public golf course. The layout will challenge you with rolling fairways and tricky doglegs. Water hazards come into play frequently so be prepared for a few intimidating blind shots over water. Mature trees line the rolling fairways and there are also strategically placed bunkers lurking along the greensides. The manageable 6,278-yard length is approachable for beginners yet there are still holes that long hitters will enjoy.

6400,Willow Oaks Golf Course,"Located in Quinton Township, Wild Oaks Country Club is a 27-hole course that is conveniently located near all major bridges and highways in the tri-state area, making it easily accessible from Delaware and Pennsylvania. The holes are divided into three nines called Willow Oaks, Pin Oaks, and White Cedar. The club is named after the four ancient oak trees that stood on the site when construction of the courses began in the 1960s. Unfortunately only one has been able to withstand the test of time, and golfers get a chance to admire this 450-year old tree on the second fairway of one of the golf course's nines. The Willow Oaks/Pin Oaks Course starts with the longest nine and ends with the shortest. All three courses are player friendly enough for beginners with affordable rates that any skill level can enjoy.",https://progolfadvisor.com/best-golf-courses-in-kansas/,,,,,,

The course is player friendly enough for beginners at a manageable 6,640 yards from the back tees, but the many water hazards and strategically placed sand traps that you'll encounter make it enough of a challenge to appeal to more advanced players. The long fairways demand accuracy but it's not an overly punishing layout off of the tees. It's a golf course that is as scenic as it is challenging with each hole offering a different setting. In addition to the golf course, Prince George has one of the most extensive practice facilities in the area, featuring chipping and putting areas where you can work on your short game and a driving range.",http://www.princegeorgegolfclub.com/,,,,,,

The par-70 layout has both links-style holes and more traditional, tree-lined holes. The front nine is more player friendly. There are some good opportunities to build up your score before facing the tougher back nine. It's a tighter layout with more trees, demanding accuracy and careful course management. A stream meanders through the golf course, connecting to the ponds that also come into play, especially on the back nine. There are also several strategically placed bunkers that lurk along the greensides.
