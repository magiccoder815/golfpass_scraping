39,Avila Beach Resort,"Avila Beach Golf Resort is located right along the bay, giving it a scenic setting that has made it the most well known of the Central Coast golf courses. The layout offers plenty of variety with a hilly front nine that features small, often elevated, greens that are surrounded by oak-lined valleys and a back nine that that is routed across a tidal estuary. Golfers should be prepared for forced carries over water and multi-tiered greens on the backside. At first the course may seem short, but thanks to the dramatic elevation changes and numerous other challenges, it will begin to feel much longer. There are several severe doglegs throughout as well as tight approaches. Avila Beach Golf Resort is not a layout where you can easily ""grip it and rip it.""

The country club sits just 10 minutes outside of downtown Cincinnati.A Scottish golfer and designer, Bendelow created several Midwest courses. Bendelow designed 800-plus North American courses, working with land he was assigned: In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, architects didn't get their turf, rocks and water features trucked in. Born Sept. 2, 1868, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bendelow began golfing when he was 9 years old, with his dad at the Balgownie Links, which now goes by Royal Aberdeen Golf Club - founded in 1780, Royal Aberdeen Golf Club is the world's sixth-oldest, and it's clear that Bendelow had rich inspiration to draw on back in Scotland.After a round of golf at the Western Hills Country Club, head back to the Grill Porch for nibbles and sips.",https://www.westernhillscc.com/,,,,,,

256,Oak Hills Country Club,"""Oak Hills is classic golf architecture at its finest,"" says Carl Bielstein, La Cantera's director of golf, about Oak Hills Country Club's heritage and its noted architect, A.W. Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.oakhillscc.com/,,,,,,

445,Soldiers Creek Golf Club At The Preserve,"The course at Soldiers Creek Golf Club was designed by Scott Clark, a former Golf Course Superintendent at The Grand Hotel in Point Clear Alabama and the current Superintendent at The Peninsula Golf Club in Gulf Shores Alabama. While this is Scott's first attempt in playing the role of a course architect, it also reveals his depth of experience in the golf course industry. The design goals of building a course that would be enjoyable for high handicappers as well as low handicappers was met in this design.The course features wide player-friendly fairways. Also, water comes into play on only two holes which makes navigating this course easier for high handicappers. A large natural turf driving range and 10,000 square foot practice green is available as a warm-up or practice area.Soldiers Creek Golf Club is owned by the Norman Woerner family. Norman is a member of the Woerner Turf family of sod producers. Woerner Turf is a world-wide leader in turf production. The company provides turf for many golf courses ranging from Augusta National to new courses in Hong Kong. They also supply the turf for the NFL Super Bowl and the NFL Pro Bowl in Hawaii.Southern Turf Nurseries provided the Tif Eagle for Soldiers Creek Golf Club. This turf grass is considered by many to be the best-of-the-best turf for southern golf course greens. The fairways and roughs are Tif 419, a dense-growing emerald-colored grass that's perfect for plush fairways.The greens feature Tif Eagle, the newest and best-of-the-best southern turf grass for golf course greens. An increasingly popular choice for new golf courses and redesigns, this turf permits a closer cut, thus allowing for smoother, faster greens.Located only several miles from Alabama's sun-kissed Gulf Coast, this new 18 hole championship course is part of the Woerner Preserve Resort. Our friendly staff welcomes you to play the newest course on the Gulf Coast. Yes, we are now open. Come spend some time with family or friends. Relax and enjoy a round of golf in this natural setting.DIRECTIONS: From I-10, take exit 44 (Gulf Shores Pkwy/Hwy 59 South). Travel south on Hwy 59 for approx. 18 miles. Turn left onto Hwy 98 (at light in Foley). Travel approx. 10 miles to Co. Rd 95. Turn right and go 1 ½ mile. Course is on the left.",https://www.soldierscreekgolfcourse.com/,,,,,,

The parkland layout has a beautifully rolling terrain that provides dramatic elevation changes throughout. The course has a balance of excellent shot values and interesting challenges that will appeal to players of all skill levels. The greens can be especially tricky since they are fast, undulating, and often putt downhill. There are numerous bunkers lurking around the greens and water hazards come into play on nearly every hole, 16 to be exact. Proper club selection and accurate shot placement will be generously rewarded but the golf course is not overly punishing if you're a little off your game. The signature hole is the par-5 third, which requires an approach shot to an island green.",https://www.metamoragolf.com/,,,,,,
840,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

Water hazards come into play on a few holes and towering trees line the fairways. The greens are fast and the rough can be punishing.

The course was also lengthened by 300 yards. In addition to the strategically placed bunkers and mature trees, water also comes into play on a few holes in the form of ponds and streams and the gently rolling terrain provides a few tricky lies.

The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is.

The layout has an interesting mix of holes with some that have a Scottish-links style while others are so lined with trees that it feels like you're in the North woods. Overall, it's a player-friendly golf course but there are some challenging par 5s and you'll definitely get a chance to work on your iron game. Heritage Glen's sixth hole might turn out to be one of the hardest par 5s you'll ever play. It stretches to 625 yards from the back tees with a marsh to the left and a bunker surrounding the green.

This infamous hole features a tee that sits high above a treacherous green that is surrounded on three sides by water and even further protected with three sand traps. The hole is also completely isolated thanks to the surrounding mature trees. There is another par 3 on the golf course that is almost as equally tough, the 15th.

His design includes more traditional elements such as wide fairways and large greens, but there are many challenges in store on this formidable golf course. The front nine, dubbed the ""forest nine,"" demands accuracy due to the presence of towering mature trees but the open back nine is characterized by pristine white sand dunes. Water hazards and bunkers come into play frequently throughout the entire Forest Dunes golf course.

Golfers should be prepared for a variety of elevation changes and tricky uneven lies. Natural marsh areas come into play and there is a combination of conventional and pot bunkers, some with sod walls that make recovery difficult. Trees and mounding border the fairways and the challenging greens features a mix of ridges, tiers, and undulations. The no. 1 handicap hole is the second, which is both dramatically scenic and hard, This tough par 4 can be reached in regulation with a risky shot over the wetlands or it can be played safe to the right on the second shot.",https://doublejj.com/thoroughbred-golf-club/,,,,,,

It's easy to get distracted on this visually stunning golf course, but it's a test that requires all of your attention. The first hole is challenging but gentler than the next three holes, which is one of the toughest sequences in the area.

The holes on the backside are more heavily treed and demand greater accuracy. Strategically placed bunkers frame the greens, making the approaches even more intimidating, and the river also comes into play. Straight shots will be rewarded at Pine River G.C. but it's not an overly punishing layout for the high handicapper.

Both golf courses are spread across rolling hills covered with mature pine forests, encapsulating the best that northern Michigan golf has to offer. Although they share the same scenic landscape, the courses have a unique character as well as a different set of challenges. Betsie Valley's tight layout and small greens make it a true shot-maker's course. Many of the greens are also severely sloped, making them even more challenging.

Each hole has a unique design that combines strategically placed bunkers, including large waste bunkers, and sloping grass swales. There is also carefully sculpted mounding along the edges of the fairways. On top of that, water comes into play on nearly every hole. English Turn's signature hole, the 15th, is a tricky par 5 with an island green but it's the final hole, a par 4 with water all along the left side, that is rumored to be the golf course's toughest.",https://www.englishturngolf.com/,,,,,,

1229,"Bluffs on Thompson Creek, The","The Bluffs on Thompson Creek enjoys a beautiful setting tucked away amid mature hardwood forests. Creeks freely meander throughout the golf course, interconnecting with the sparkling ponds that can be found throughout. The layout is an Arnold Palmer design that takes advantage of the hills, bluffs, and hollows of the varied landscape. You face uneven lies and a few blind shots thanks to the terrain but you'll also get scenic views of the surrounding area. Accuracy is important to have but it's not an overly punishing layout if you happen to be errant. The golf course has a challenging start with an uphill par 3 as the opening hole. Another memorable hole is the par-3 eighth, which features a 50-foot drop to the fairway below. It's both an intimidating and beautiful hole.",https://thebluffs.com/,,,,,,

The course is a challenging test without being too intimidating for beginners. It offers risk-reward holes that will appeal to low and high handicappers alike. Lee Schmidt, who worked closely with Pete Dye, designed the golf course, and incorporated many of Dye's signature features into the design. Sculpted mounding and native grasses frame the generous landing areas and you'll even find Dye's trademark railroad ties framing the greens. There are also several lakes that come into play throughout. Oak Harbor Golf Club's seventh and 15th holes are particularly notable for their intimidating tee shots over water. If you strategize carefully, the four par 5s provide some birdie opportunities but you'll have to carefully navigate through a combination of water, traps, and undulations.",https://www.oakharborgolf.com/,,,,,,

The club first opened in 1969 with a nine-hole golf course, which was later expanded to 18 holes in 1972. A renovation of the golf course resulted in a redesign of five holes on the front nine and a new irrigation system. Southbrook Golf & Country Club now plays to a 6,560 yards and its new challenges demand precision and keen course strategy. The meandering Welland river snakes through the golf course as well, coming into play on 13 holes while also enhancing the natural beauty of the course.",https://southbrookgolf.ca/,,,,,,
1279,Austin Country Club,"Back around 1900, when the greater Austin area was only home to about 25,000 residents, Harvard Law School graduate and lifetime Austinite Lewis Hancock organized one of Texas’ first formal country clubs, the venerable Austin Country Club.The first nine-hole course, now known as Hancock Park, featured sand greens and a tiny two-room framed clubhouse. The club stayed put for half a century, noted for the presence of Harvey Penick. Then after a huge local debate, the facility was moved to Riverside Drive in East Austin. From there it made it another 35 years before moving to its current Davenport Ranch location.The current ACC layout, designed by Pete Dye, rests on the shores of Lake Austin and the Colorado River. Dye didn’t veer from his usual method of creating an impressively difficult track using his trademark railroad ties, deep pot bunkers, and huge undulations.The opening holes play along Lake Austin, and are more of a links-style design. Afterwards the Hill Country takes effect, featuring canyons, ravines, creeks, and unbelievable views.The back nine features many outstanding holes, including the 446-yard No. 11, which deceptively doglegs left along a canyon before requiring an approach over that same deep ravine. The par 3 No. 16 also stands out, featuring a long carry over another canyon.",https://www.austincountryclub.com/,,,,,,

Suffice it to say that those strings would never be pulled in today’s environmentally conscious age.Getting there : From Highway 620 west, drive about 6 miles past the dam and turn right on Lakeway Drive.

The course was designed to blend seamlessly into the natural setting while still testing your shot-making skills. You won’t find any man-made water hazards or artificial mounding on this golf course, instead you’ll be challenged by natural streams and ponds and mature evergreens. At first glance, the layout is seemingly wide open, but don’t let your guard down because the fairways are actually quite tight and many of them are strategically lined with trees. In keeping with the time it was built, the greens are smaller than those you would find on most modern golf courses and heavily protected by sand traps. Over the years, Mattawang Golf Club has built a reputation for having some of the well maintained putting surfaces in the area.",https://www.mattawang-golf.com/,,,,,,

2462,Oak Valley Golf Club,"This course used to be considered a hidden gem. Now, Oak Valley Golf Course in Beaumont is an off-the-beaten-path known reasonable joy. Stopping on the way from Los Angeles to Palm Springs for a golf detour is no fool's play. Not with the fast greens, dramatic elevation changes and swerving fairways available at Oak Valley in Beaumont.A Lee Schmidt and Brian Curley design, Oak Valley is probably best known for greens that are anything but desert typical. Speed is the name of the game here, with a tap sometimes too much on a downhill putt.Recognition does not travel that quickly. It took a decade for Oak Valley to get a four star rating from Golf Digest. Once it did, Beaumont suddenly became a golf stopping spot on the Palm Springs express. Now, you're considered a smart golfer if you linger on the way to Palm Springs.""It's a nice getaway from the crowds in the desert, as well as some of the other, more populated golf areas,"" head pro Scott Arnold said. ""It's almost like being in the country. No houses line the fairways. Each hole is different. And because of the way it's laid out, you often can't even see another hole from the one you're playing.""",http://www.oakvalleygolf.com/,,,,,,

Elaborate hills and greenside swales protect many of the putting complexes. The putting surfaces on the front nine are relatively calm when compared to the back nine where most of the greens are double-tiered, ridged, or layered.

In addition to the course, Olde Fort has a driving range as well as chipping and putting greens for golfers to use.

2660,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

Like many golf courses in the area, Yadkin is routed up and down rolling terrain and through mature trees. The layout is challenging with an interesting mix of holes, none of which run parallel to each other. The par 3s are long and there are a few reachable par 5s. The par 4s will make you think, requiring thoughtful drives and approaches. Strategically placed bunkers and mounding lurk throughout and water hazards come into play on a few holes.

The layout has a wide open front nine before it moves onto hillier, more wooded terrain. The first nine holes are more forgiving than the back nine, allowing some room for error off the tees. The back nine is a scenic round of holes, sprawling across gently rolling hills studded with mature trees. There are also some challenging par 3s that require a carry over water. Sedgewood Country Club is a diverse golf course that is approachable for all skill levels and made even more accommodating thanks to three different sets of tees.",,,,,,,

There are also some par 4s in the 450-yard range. The 6,521-yard length indicated on the scorecard can be deceiving since it feels much longer when you're playing it. The golf course has plenty of variety, including dogleg lefts, doglegs rights, short holes, and long holes. Thanks to its mountaintop locale, Cold Spring C.C. offers stunning views that are as diverse as the holes. The vistas from the elevated tees and greens stretch to the Berkshires, Connecticut, and Vermont. From the golf course's highest tee box on the par-3 10th, you'll have a panoramic view of central Massachusetts.",https://www.coldspringcc.com/,,,,,,

There is also a surprising amount of elevation changes throughout that make the course even more challenging. The occasional water hazard comes into play but they do not pose a serious threat. Good course management is key but overall it is a playable round no matter what your skill level though it doesn't hurt to warm up on the club's driving range or putting green. Pine Hills G.C. location nestled within the forest may explain why it is still one of the best-kept secrets in central Wisconsin.",https://www.pinehillsgolf.net/,,,,,,

The golf course blends seamlessly with the scenic surroundings. Strategically placed bunkers fiercely protect the greens and golfers should also be prepared for some tricky forced carries. The fairways are generous and forgiving though. The course is a fair test but it is especially tough on windy days. The interior, tree-lined holes contrast nicely with the waterfront holes and they have the added benefit of protection from the prevailing sea breezes. North Shore Country Club is a player-friendly layout that both beginners and seasoned players can enjoy, which is why it has become one of the Outer Banks' most popular golfing destinations.",https://www.northshoregolfcoursenc.com/,,,,,,

The championship layout features a variety of challenges including tree-lined fairways, water hazards, and strategically placed sand traps. There are also a few sharp doglegs to watch out for. It's the many elevation changes though, which can range from subtle to dramatic, that are the true test of this golf course. Be prepared for several tricky uphill, downhill, and sidehill lies. From the tips, Holland Hills Country Club is quite formidable but multiple sets of tees make it more player friendly for all skill levels.",http://hollandhillscountryclub.com/,,,,,,

It's one of western New York's most accessible public golf courses. The course opened in 1930 as the first public nine-hole layout in LeRoy. The creation of the golf course was spearheaded by Orator Woodward, youngest song of Jell-O magnate Donald Woodward. He believed the landscape of rolling hills and meandering streams was the ideal setting for a round of golf. The natural contours of the terrain helped to determine the placement of the bunkers. Water comes into play on a few holes at LeRoy Country Club, most notably on the finishing two. A large lake on the 17th turns into a creek that wanders across the middle of the final par-3 hole.",http://www.leroycc.com/,,,,,,

Skillful players could even try to use the contours to their advantage. Each hole has a bunkers but the bunkering is not excessive. In addition to the mounding and bunkering, the undulating terrain provides natural elevation changes. The golf course finishes with what is arguably its toughest hole. This monster par 5 is 620 yards from the back tees. It requires a drive over a ravine with a natural waste area to the left.

One of the trickiest holes is the par-3 third, which requires a carry over a massive lake to a small green. Although there are also mature trees lining the fairways, the holes are fairly straightforward. Beginners can approach this golf course with confidence but more advanced players will find it to be a fun casual round. The Gold Course is a better option for a tougher challenge.

Formerly a stable, the course features large meadows and dense groves of trees that frame the fairways and greens. The layout has a more traditional, links design that features occasional water hazards, most notably on the par-5 ninth and 18th holes that share a large lake, but the tree-covered hills are the true challenge of the golf course. Although there are many difficult elements on this course, five sets of tees make it accessible for players of all skill levels. Royal Ontario Golf Club is often compared to the Masters Course at Lionhead Golf & Country Club.",https://kaneffgolf.com/golf/courses/royal-ontario/,,,,,,
3212,Broadacres Golf Club,"Broadacres Golf Club is situated in southern Rockland County on the border between New York and New Jersey. Its convenient location allows for easy access from both states and it's only a 20-minute ride from midtown Manhattan. The golf course has nine holes with an alternate set of tees for an 18-hole round. The layout sprawls across rolling hills dappled with towering oak trees. The golf course incorporates a variety of elevation changes that range from subtle to dramatic. With narrow, tree-lined fairways and undulating greens, accuracy will serve you well on this course. You'll face several doglegs and there are strategically placed bunkers fiercely guarding the greens. Broadacres Golf Club's signature third hole is one of the toughest holes in the area. This par 3 plays up a steep hill to an undulating green.",https://www.broadacresgolf.com/,,,,,,

Several strategically placed bunkers lurk along the greens and a few water hazards also come into play, most notably on the par-5 third hole where a lake sits in the center of the fairway. Red Hook Golf Club finishes with a tough par 4 that requires a tee shot over a deep hollow to a sloped fairway with trees and a pond lining the left side. After that, you'll be faced with an elevated green protected in front by steep bunkers.",https://redhookgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

3419,Great Rock Golf Club,"Opened in 2001, Great Rock Golf Club is one of the newer golf clubs in Long Island but it feels much older thanks to its scenic landscape of rolling green hills covered with mature forests. The mountainous landscape provides plenty of elevation changes that make it difficult to find a flat lie. At 6,254 yards, the course is short but it is still a challenging round with narrow, tree-lined fairways that demand accuracy. There is hardly any water on the golf course but with strategically placed bunkers, sidehill lies, and towering trees to contend with, golfers will hardly notice the absence of water hazards. Great Rock's signature hole is the challenging 10th. This par-4 beast is a double uphill climb with a seemingly flat green, but if you read it that way, you're in for some trouble.",http://www.greatrockgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

3513,Hillcrest Golf Club,"Alvin's second country club opened in the 1960s, built by a man named Shorty Plaster who wanted to make the most of his land investment. Shorty was a hacker and his short course is designed to accommodate the lesser golfer with its executive-like 2,385-yard length.Plaster's design opens up with three par 3s, followed by another on No. 5. Every par 4 plays 350 yards or less, and the sole par 5 is only 475 yards. Not many non-par-3 9-holers are blessed with lights, but this one is. The same goes for the driving range, so you can definitely spend some hours at this nice little country course.Getting there : From I-45 south, exit Dixie Farm Rd. and turn right. Drive 8 miles to where it dead-ends, then turn on Hwy 35. Drive 8 miles to Fairway Dr. and turn left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2726,,,,,,

The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is.

The winding layout has many doglegs and incorporates a variety of elevation changes. Golfers should be prepared for a fair amount of blind shots as well as uneven lies. The spacious golf course has several holes that will please long hitters, but this layout will test your accuracy and course-management skills too. Water comes into play most memorably on Greencastle's signature third hole where there is a man-made waterfall and fountain but the par-4 10th is the toughest. This hole has an island green that is cut in half by a large drop in elevation, a good test for the two following holes which are not any less challenging.",https://greencastlegolf.com/,,,,,,

4167,Colonial Country Club,"Colonial Country Club, located in Fort Worth on the southern banks of the Trinity River and near TCU, is one of the most historic golf clubs in Texas. The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times. Other multiple winners of this longstanding PGA Tour event include Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Nick Price and Ben Crenshaw.",https://www.colonialgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings.

Nicklaus utilized the natural features of the site including the lakes and streams, rolling terrain, and abundant wetlands.

All of the holes were carefully carved from the surrounding woodlands and molded into the hillsides. An abundance of trees characterizes the course, giving all of the holes a secluded feel that is further enhanced by the design, which doesn't feature any parallel fairways. The Trail/Blue Course combines the shortest and longest nines but both are considered slightly more challenging than the Ridge nine. The Trail nine possesses two of the four water holes at the club.

The heathlands layout feels like a links course with wind being an important factor and thick fescue coming into play. The golf course starts with an especially tough front nine but there are more scoring opportunities on the back. Mounded bunkers and moguls define the movement of the fairways and though there aren't many trees, if you don't keep your shots straight you might find yourself out-of-bounds or lost in the high, wiry grass. Sidehill lies await you as well as a few blind shots. Wyncote's greens have little undulation but the lightning fast putting surfaces are a challenge for players of all skill levels.

The East Course, the original layout, has hosted a number of legendary players, including Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead, since 1912. Ross carefully sculpted the mountainous landscape to create a course that is both challenging and memorable. It is shorter and tighter than the other course but they are equal in level of difficulty.

The golf course is known for its playability but there are several challenges in store that will test your shot-making skills. The course starts out mildly with a front nine that sprawls across gently undulating meadows while the back nine gets hillier and more challenging. There are more lakes and strategically placed bunkers that come into play on the back as well as a hidden brook that is just waiting for errant shots. Regent's Glen's 11th hole is one of the most intimidating, with a large lake along the fairway. If you dare to carry a portion of this hazard, you'll be rewarded with a shorter approach to the flagstick, however the hidden brook and deep bunker in front of the green will make that very difficult. You'll have to choose your strategy carefully and proper club selection is also key.",https://www.regentsglen.com/,,,,,,

4574,Portage Country Club,"Portage Country Club is situated along the scenic shores of Swan Lake. Opened in 1930, the golf course has a traditional layout that is both challenging and playable. At 6,356 yards from the back tees, it is shorter than most championship courses you will find today but the layout still has plenty to offer besides length. There is a mix of holes that are wide-open and some that are framed by stands of mature trees. The rolling terrain provides subtle but tricky undulations in the greens and fairways as well as the occasional double-tiered green. One of the most memorable holes for both its level of difficulty and the scenery is the par-4 third. This no. 1 handicap hole plays along the lake and forces you to keep a close eye on the target.",https://portagecc.net/,,,,,,

His unwavering dedication to preserving the natural landscapes he works with is also apparent in the unspoiled beauty of the terrain. Hundreds of mature trees cover the golf course, which extends beyond 7,000 yards from the tips.

The greens putt true and fast but they are known for their massive size. There are some that measure in at over 10,000 square feet. Proper placement is the key to this demanding layout.

The heavily wooded back nine presents an entirely different challenge. Drawing more from the style of classic American courses, the back nine has a dramatic rolling landscape blanketed with trees, which often come into play along the fairways. From the blustery fairways on the front nine to the narrows fairways of the back as well as the large, fast greens throughout, Jefferson Golf & Country Club demands accuracy from start to finish.

5177,Inverness Club,"Inverness Club in Toledo is one of the Midwest’s most prestigious tournament venues. The club was founded in 1903 and hired Donald Ross in 1916 to design a championship-caliber, 18-hole course. He delivered, and the 1920 U.S. Open was soon held here. It has hosted four U.S. Opens, two PGA Championships and a U.S. Amateur. It is also the host of the 2020 LPGA Drive On Championship and 2021 Solheim Cup. The course has been renovated, expanded and redesigned over the 100-plus years of existence. Architect Andrew Green extensively restored the Donald Ross layout in 2018, while also adding some new features as a result of property expansion. The cathedral clock, still on display in the clubhouse, was presented by the participants of the 1920 U.S. Open, and Inverness was the first club to permit the players into the member’s clubhouse. Inverness’ crest is inscribed with the Latin words “Concordia et Fidelitas,” which translates to “Harmony and Faithfulness.”",https://invernessclub.com/,,,,,,
