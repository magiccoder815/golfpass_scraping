The country club sits just 10 minutes outside of downtown Cincinnati.A Scottish golfer and designer, Bendelow created several Midwest courses. Bendelow designed 800-plus North American courses, working with land he was assigned: In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, architects didn't get their turf, rocks and water features trucked in. Born Sept. 2, 1868, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bendelow began golfing when he was 9 years old, with his dad at the Balgownie Links, which now goes by Royal Aberdeen Golf Club - founded in 1780, Royal Aberdeen Golf Club is the world's sixth-oldest, and it's clear that Bendelow had rich inspiration to draw on back in Scotland.After a round of golf at the Western Hills Country Club, head back to the Grill Porch for nibbles and sips.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10555,,,,,,

Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3302,,,,,,

The course has a traditional design that is player-friendly enough to appeal to beginners while also offering a few challenges. There are numerous bunkers strategically placed throughout and water hazards also come into play on a few holes. It is not the most formidable test but more advanced players will still have fun, especially if they are just looking for a quick round.

While this is Scott's first attempt in playing the role of a course architect, it also reveals his depth of experience in the golf course industry. The design goals of building a course that would be enjoyable for high handicappers as well as low handicappers was met in this design.The course features wide player-friendly fairways. Also, water comes into play on only two holes which makes navigating this course easier for high handicappers. A large natural turf driving range and 10,000 square foot practice green is available as a warm-up or practice area.Soldiers Creek Golf Club is owned by the Norman Woerner family. Norman is a member of the Woerner Turf family of sod producers. Woerner Turf is a world-wide leader in turf production. The company provides turf for many golf courses ranging from Augusta National to new courses in Hong Kong. They also supply the turf for the NFL Super Bowl and the NFL Pro Bowl in Hawaii.Southern Turf Nurseries provided the Tif Eagle for Soldiers Creek Golf Club. This turf grass is considered by many to be the best-of-the-best turf for southern golf course greens. The fairways and roughs are Tif 419, a dense-growing emerald-colored grass that's perfect for plush fairways.The greens feature Tif Eagle, the newest and best-of-the-best southern turf grass for golf course greens. An increasingly popular choice for new golf courses and redesigns, this turf permits a closer cut, thus allowing for smoother, faster greens.Located only several miles from Alabama's sun-kissed Gulf Coast, this new 18 hole championship course is part of the Woerner Preserve Resort. Our friendly staff welcomes you to play the newest course on the Gulf Coast. Yes, we are now open. Come spend some time with family or friends. Relax and enjoy a round of golf in this natural setting.DIRECTIONS: From I-10, take exit 44 (Gulf Shores Pkwy/Hwy 59 South). Travel south on Hwy 59 for approx. 18 miles.

Always helpful, with smiles on their faces, and particularly friendly to out-of-towners, it sure makes it a joy to play golf when you’re treated with that sort of charming hospitality.Golf is even better nowadays in Decatur because of the renovated greens, which look pristine and roll true. This course is flat, with water in play on about 3 holes, and the par 36 design offers a good combination of holes. The opener is testy, and not an easy par–it plays 440 yards to a par 4. There are three par 3s, two of which require long irons, and three par 5s, one of which is listed as the number one handicap: the No. 6 hole at 542 yards.Getting there : From Hwy, 380 exit, take the Airport exit and cross over the highway.

Like many of Ross' designs, the phrase ""hard par, easy bogey"" holds true here. The layout features small greens with crown centers that are sloped back to front.

The golf club bought the old Nashville Golf and Country Club's clubhouse and land for $22,500, leased an additional 92 acres on which to build an 18-hole golf course and enlisted the golf course architect Donald Ross to lay it all out.Of course, golfers at the Richland Country Club today are playing an all-new golf course in an all-new spot, this one a Jack Nicklaus Signature Golf Course that runs alongside the Granny White Park.After a round at the Richland Country Club, head back to the clubhouse and the Waxo Greene Grille for casual eats and sweet vistas of the golf course, not to mention a round around the fireplace.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12615,,,,,,

For more advanced players, the golf course is great for squeezing in a quick round or for getting in some short game practice. It can be played as a relatively quick 18-hole round too. In addition to the course, Olde Fort has a driving range as well as chipping and putting greens for golfers to use. The course may not have the most challenging design or extensive amenities, but it is popular nonetheless since it is one of the best values in the area.",,,,,,,

Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

The first hole is challenging but gentler than the next three holes, which is one of the toughest sequences in the area.

The course's namesake river weaves in and out of the holes. The course has a challenging layout that offers front and back nines that are completely different. Take advantage of the scoring opportunities on the fairly forgiving front nine because you're in for a tougher test on the back nine. The holes on the backside are more heavily treed and demand greater accuracy. Strategically placed bunkers frame the greens, making the approaches even more intimidating, and the river also comes into play. Straight shots will be rewarded at Pine River G.C. but it's not an overly punishing layout for the high handicapper. The 6,481-yard layout has a variety of different holes, giving it appeal for players of all skill levels and the manageable length makes it more approachable for beginners.",,,,,,,

The greens will test your accuracy but they're not overly challenging. Meandering streams crisscross the golf course, cutting through fairways and running alongside some of the holes.

Both golf courses are spread across rolling hills covered with mature pine forests, encapsulating the best that northern Michigan golf has to offer. Although they share the same scenic landscape, the courses have a unique character as well as a different set of challenges. Betsie Valley's tight layout and small greens make it a true shot-maker's course. Many of the greens are also severely sloped, making them even more challenging.

The club was established in 1929, making it one of the state's older courses. The player-friendly layout has a traditional design that is on the shorter side, measuring to just over 5,900 yards from the back tees. The holes are fairly straightforward and there are no hidden hazards. The golf course does require a fair amount of accuracy though with mature trees lining the fairways. There are also strategically placed sand bunkers guarding most of the greens. It might not what you are looking for if you are searching for a formidable test, but it is great for a casual round. Riverdale Country Club is also gentle enough for beginners to approach with confidence.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13860,,,,,,

Robert Trent Jones, Sr. designed the course, crafting a challenging test that has been ranked as one of the most difficult golf courses in the country. You'll have to contend with 80 strategically placed sand bunkers and 17 different water hazards. While the course is not overly punishing, you'll have to be prepared to have every aspect of your game tested.

Each hole has a unique design that combines strategically placed bunkers, including large waste bunkers, and sloping grass swales. There is also carefully sculpted mounding along the edges of the fairways. On top of that, water comes into play on nearly every hole.

The layout is an Arnold Palmer design that takes advantage of the hills, bluffs, and hollows of the varied landscape. You face uneven lies and a few blind shots thanks to the terrain but you'll also get scenic views of the surrounding area. Accuracy is important to have but it's not an overly punishing layout if you happen to be errant. The golf course has a challenging start with an uphill par 3 as the opening hole. Another memorable hole is the par-3 eighth, which features a 50-foot drop to the fairway below. It's both an intimidating and beautiful hole.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15614,,,,,,

The course is a challenging test without being too intimidating for beginners. It offers risk-reward holes that will appeal to low and high handicappers alike. Lee Schmidt, who worked closely with Pete Dye, designed the golf course, and incorporated many of Dye's signature features into the design. Sculpted mounding and native grasses frame the generous landing areas and you'll even find Dye's trademark railroad ties framing the greens. There are also several lakes that come into play throughout. Oak Harbor Golf Club's seventh and 15th holes are particularly notable for their intimidating tee shots over water.

The club stayed put for half a century, noted for the presence of Harvey Penick. Then after a huge local debate, the facility was moved to Riverside Drive in East Austin. From there it made it another 35 years before moving to its current Davenport Ranch location.The current ACC layout, designed by Pete Dye, rests on the shores of Lake Austin and the Colorado River. Dye didn’t veer from his usual method of creating an impressively difficult track using his trademark railroad ties, deep pot bunkers, and huge undulations.The opening holes play along Lake Austin, and are more of a links-style design. Afterwards the Hill Country takes effect, featuring canyons, ravines, creeks, and unbelievable views.The back nine features many outstanding holes, including the 446-yard No. 11, which deceptively doglegs left along a canyon before requiring an approach over that same deep ravine.

Located in the tranquil community of Granville, the course sits on the western part of the Appalachian Plateau. Experienced golfers will not find the golf course to be overly challenging by any means but it is good for a quick, casual round. With three sets of tees, it provides good practice for players of any skill level. The par-35 layout has a diverse mix of two par 3s and par 5s each, and five par 4s. Indian Hills Golf Course is fair and gentle enough for even the most amateur beginners. Just minutes from the course are Granville's historic offerings, including 18th-century churches and state buildings, many of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",,,,,,,

Tiger actually won the Las Vegas Invitational (then a 90-hole, multi-course event) with a final round 64 on the private TPC at Summerlin track, erasing David Love III's four-stroke lead.Average hackers will find a course with plenty of trees in the desert and five inventive par 3s that give National much of its character. This isn't desert golf. It's old school golf with palm trees and sand.It is also very close to the Strip, just a few turns and about a 10-minute drive away. The area's built up around it with fast-food shops, but the Rat Pack era style remains alive within Las Vegas National's grounds.""As you pull into the lot at Las Vegas National, the sense of the sixties is evident in the rectangular pastel colored stucco clubhouse that might have seemed modernistic back then, but now is a charming reminder of an architecturally dated style,"" TravelGolf.com writer Doug Saunders said.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15937,,,,,,

It is a par-60 executive layout that offers the perfect level of challenge for beginners, juniors, and senior golfers. It is the sister course to Delray Beach Golf Club, a championship course that is less than a mile away. Opened in 1972, the golf course has a classic design that measures just over 3,000 yards. The terrain is mostly flat, making it an enjoyable course to walk. Despite its length the holes have the feel of a championship course. There are 14 par 3s, a fair share of which are quite challenging as opposed to the uniform par 3s you see on some executive courses. For more advanced players, it is a great place to get in a quick round of practice.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1999,,,,,,

The traditional layout has withstood the test of time as a challenging but playable layout. The course was designed to blend seamlessly into the natural setting while still testing your shot-making skills. You won’t find any man-made water hazards or artificial mounding on this golf course, instead you’ll be challenged by natural streams and ponds and mature evergreens. At first glance, the layout is seemingly wide open, but don’t let your guard down because the fairways are actually quite tight and many of them are strategically lined with trees. In keeping with the time it was built, the greens are smaller than those you would find on most modern golf courses and heavily protected by sand traps.

The course is seemingly short at only 6,236 yards but it shouldn't be taken lightly. It's much more challenging than it appears. The layout finishes with two of its toughest holes. The 17th has a tough green fiercely guarded by out-of-bounds and the course saved the most difficult hole for last. This par 3 will test even the most seasoned golfers. In addition to the golf course, Colts Neck also has a 25-station driving range that stays open late.

The entire Wedgewood layout sprawls across gentle undulating terrain, providing subtle breaks throughout that will test your skills. There are two holes that are particularly memorable, the 13th, one of the toughest par 4s in the area, and the 17th, a tough par 5. The 13th is a lengthy par 4 that requires a second shot over water with a long club to a difficult target.

Not with the fast greens, dramatic elevation changes and swerving fairways available at Oak Valley in Beaumont.A Lee Schmidt and Brian Curley design, Oak Valley is probably best known for greens that are anything but desert typical. Speed is the name of the game here, with a tap sometimes too much on a downhill putt.Recognition does not travel that quickly. It took a decade for Oak Valley to get a four star rating from Golf Digest. Once it did, Beaumont suddenly became a golf stopping spot on the Palm Springs express. Now, you're considered a smart golfer if you linger on the way to Palm Springs.""It's a nice getaway from the crowds in the desert, as well as some of the other, more populated golf areas,"" head pro Scott Arnold said. ""It's almost like being in the country. No houses line the fairways. Each hole is different.

The golf course stretches across a lush, gently rolling landscape sprinkled with mature trees and ponds. The terrain showcases the best in Triangle golf. At just over 6,600 yards it is not particularly long, but it provides plenty of challenges. It is a tight course that will test your accuracy with narrow fairways lined with trees. The small greens that are heavily protected by well placed bunkers demand thoughtful strategy and pinpoint control. The golf course offers a fair challenge but it is still accessible for beginners, especially from the forward tees.

The relatively flat course is wide-open, subjecting it to the blustery ocean breezes. The wind is definitely the most challenging factor on the golf course, with proof provided by the wind-shaped live oaks and Yaupon trees that are scattered throughout. Water hazards come into play on nine holes. There are also 37 strategically placed bunkers and challenging rough areas. Oak Island Golf Club is tough even for more advanced players, especially on a windy day, but it is more forgiving than it seems so beginners shouldn't feel too intimidated.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/9926,,,,,,

Each hole provides a dramatically different challenge and unique scenery. Views of the winding river can be enjoyed on almost every hole. A variety of bunkers and doglegs are strategically placed throughout the golf course, demanding both accuracy and thoughtful strategy.

The golf course is interwoven with a meandering creek that is connected to three ponds, all of which come into play on several holes throughout the course. The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings.

The terrain accounts for most of the golf course's difficulty but the lofty elevations also provide stunning views. The natural contours helped to determine the strategic placement of the bunkers.

The championship layout incorporates the plentiful water and woods of the natural terrain. The white sand bunkers that are strategically placed throughout add a beautiful contrast to the lush green of the golf course. The undulating terrain is one of the layout's most prominent features. Elaborate hills and greenside swales protect many of the putting complexes. The putting surfaces on the front nine are relatively calm when compared to the back nine where most of the greens are double-tiered, ridged, or layered. The par-4 15th is one of Stonebridge Golf Club's most scenic and challenging holes. With water in front, back, and right of the green, this is one of the toughest approaches on the back nine.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15148,,,,,,

Situated along the Roanoke Sound, the rugged coastline and rolling sand dunes perfectly mimic a classic links landscape. The golf course is a shot maker's layout that will test your skills but it is still player friendly enough to appeal to all skill levels. You'll need a sharp short game for sure, but you won't need much length on this rather short layout. Some form of water appears on nearly every hole, including some holes that play right along the Sound, and the undulating greens can be tough. It's a challenging-but-fun round that is worth playing for the scenery alone. Unsurprisingly, Nags Head Golf Club is one of the most popular golf courses in the OBX.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10146,,,,,,

Opened in 1962, it was one of the area's first nine-hole courses. It is an ideal course for beginners, offering a layout that is gentle but has a few subtle challenges. For more advanced players, the golf course is great for squeezing in a quick round or for getting in some short game practice. It can be played as a relatively quick 18-hole round too. In addition to the course, Olde Fort has a driving range as well as chipping and putting greens for golfers to use. The course may not have the most challenging design or extensive amenities, but it is popular nonetheless since it is one of the best values in the area.",,,,,,,

Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

It offers all the facets of Southern golf without the crowds. The Yadkin Valley stretches east from the Blue Ridge Mountains across the rolling hills of the North Carolina Piedmont. Like many golf courses in the area, Yadkin is routed up and down rolling terrain and through mature trees. The layout is challenging with an interesting mix of holes, none of which run parallel to each other. The par 3s are long and there are a few reachable par 5s. The par 4s will make you think, requiring thoughtful drives and approaches. Strategically placed bunkers and mounding lurk throughout and water hazards come into play on a few holes. Yadkin Country Club is a tough but fair layout that emphasizes strategy over strength.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10328,,,,,,

It has a few challenges in store but overall it is a player-friendly course that beginners can approach with confidence. The layout has a wide open front nine before it moves onto hillier, more wooded terrain. The first nine holes are more forgiving than the back nine, allowing some room for error off the tees. The back nine is a scenic round of holes, sprawling across gently rolling hills studded with mature trees. There are also some challenging par 3s that require a carry over water. Sedgewood Country Club is a diverse golf course that is approachable for all skill levels and made even more accommodating thanks to three different sets of tees.",,,,,,,

There are also some par 4s in the 450-yard range. The 6,521-yard length indicated on the scorecard can be deceiving since it feels much longer when you're playing it. The golf course has plenty of variety, including dogleg lefts, doglegs rights, short holes, and long holes. Thanks to its mountaintop locale, Cold Spring C.C. offers stunning views that are as diverse as the holes. The vistas from the elevated tees and greens stretch to the Berkshires, Connecticut, and Vermont. From the golf course's highest tee box on the par-3 10th, you'll have a panoramic view of central Massachusetts.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/34644,,,,,,

The abundance of mature trees is the layout's defining characteristic. They shape the doglegs and line the fairways, making accuracy a necessity. There is also a surprising amount of elevation changes throughout that make the course even more challenging. The occasional water hazard comes into play but they do not pose a serious threat. Good course management is key but overall it is a playable round no matter what your skill level though it doesn't hurt to warm up on the club's driving range or putting green. Pine Hills G.C. location nestled within the forest may explain why it is still one of the best-kept secrets in central Wisconsin.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13668,,,,,,

The fairways are generous and forgiving though. The course is a fair test but it is especially tough on windy days. The interior, tree-lined holes contrast nicely with the waterfront holes and they have the added benefit of protection from the prevailing sea breezes.

It's one of western New York's most accessible public golf courses. The course opened in 1930 as the first public nine-hole layout in LeRoy. The creation of the golf course was spearheaded by Orator Woodward, youngest song of Jell-O magnate Donald Woodward. He believed the landscape of rolling hills and meandering streams was the ideal setting for a round of golf. The natural contours of the terrain helped to determine the placement of the bunkers.

The course has a classic parkland layout that plays across gently rolling hills. The fairways were cut through forests of mature hardwoods but they are wide and carefully sculpted to direct balls toward the middle. Skillful players could even try to use the contours to their advantage. Each hole has a bunkers but the bunkering is not excessive. In addition to the mounding and bunkering, the undulating terrain provides natural elevation changes. The golf course finishes with what is arguably its toughest hole. This monster par 5 is 620 yards from the back tees. It requires a drive over a ravine with a natural waste area to the left. Many consider it to be the toughest golf hole in northern Virginia.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/16248,,,,,,

The Red Course is the shorter of the two courses at 6,237 yards from the back tees. Although it is more than 500 yards shorter, it still offers plenty of challenges. There are water hazards that come into play as well as several strategically placed bunkers. One of the trickiest holes is the par-3 third, which requires a carry over a massive lake to a small green. Although there are also mature trees lining the fairways, the holes are fairly straightforward. Beginners can approach this golf course with confidence but more advanced players will find it to be a fun casual round. The Gold Course is a better option for a tougher challenge. Cedarbrook also has a full practice range and several putting and chipping greens.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/11451,,,,,,

The golf course incorporates a variety of elevation changes that range from subtle to dramatic. With narrow, tree-lined fairways and undulating greens, accuracy will serve you well on this course.

There are holes that are ideal for long hitters but you'll also have the opportunity to work on your irons and short-game skills. Several strategically placed bunkers lurk along the greens and a few water hazards also come into play, most notably on the par-5 third hole where a lake sits in the center of the fairway. Red Hook Golf Club finishes with a tough par 4 that requires a tee shot over a deep hollow to a sloped fairway with trees and a pond lining the left side.

The mountainous landscape provides plenty of elevation changes that make it difficult to find a flat lie. At 6,254 yards, the course is short but it is still a challenging round with narrow, tree-lined fairways that demand accuracy. There is hardly any water on the golf course but with strategically placed bunkers, sidehill lies, and towering trees to contend with, golfers will hardly notice the absence of water hazards. Great Rock's signature hole is the challenging 10th.

Shorty was a hacker and his short course is designed to accommodate the lesser golfer with its executive-like 2,385-yard length.Plaster's design opens up with three par 3s, followed by another on No. 5. Every par 4 plays 350 yards or less, and the sole par 5 is only 475 yards. Not many non-par-3 9-holers are blessed with lights, but this one is. The same goes for the driving range, so you can definitely spend some hours at this nice little country course.Getting there : From I-45 south, exit Dixie Farm Rd. and turn right. Drive 8 miles to where it dead-ends, then turn on Hwy 35. Drive 8 miles to Fairway Dr. and turn left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2726,,,,,,

There are also lakes and creeks, both dry and wet, coming into play throughout the golf course. The front nine's signature hole is the par-5 sixth, which has 20 acres of water bordering the entire left side, while the back nine's signature is the par-4 15th, which is considered the toughest hole on the golf course. This 446-yard hole features an elevated green that is guarded by a large bunker on the left and two creeks crossing the fairway.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3292,,,,,,

The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings.

The rolling landscape provides the layout with undulating greens and fairways. The Hope River borders the golf course's eastern side, coming into play on a few holes. A small pond also comes into play on two holes. The challenging fairways are tight and lined with mature trees including towering firs, cottonwoods, and maple trees. The small, heavily bunkered greens make the course even trickier. Meadowlands Golf & Country Club's signature hole is the par-4 14th. This hole begins with a difficult tee shot past a gully to a sharp dogleg left fairway and then moves on to a second shot to a green that is blocked by a massive oak tree to the front right.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/26530,,,,,,

The course is an enjoyable round no matter what skill level. It is not an overly difficult or long course, but it was never meant to be a formidably tough round. The design was meant to appeal to not only high handicappers but also golfers who are looking for a casual but interesting round. For this reason, the resort is an ideal place for a relaxed outing. The golf course is playable but that doesn't mean golfers won't come across a fair amount of challenges. The 13th and 18th are two particularly tricky holes. The former is a par 4 with six sand traps lining a narrow fairway, and the finishing hole is a par 3 with water lining another narrow fairway and a large pond behind the raised green.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/11492,,,,,,

Water comes into play most memorably on Greencastle's signature third hole where there is a man-made waterfall and fountain but the par-4 10th is the toughest.

The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times. Other multiple winners of this longstanding PGA Tour event include Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Nick Price and Ben Crenshaw.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/21496,,,,,,

The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is.

The course has garnered plenty of recognition over the years including being ranked as one of he best golf courses in Pennsylvania by both GolfWeek and Golf Digest. Nicklaus utilized the natural features of the site including the lakes and streams, rolling terrain, and abundant wetlands. In addition to all of the natural hazards, he also added nearly 50 strategically placed bunkers.

The three different nines are natural named Blue, Ridge, and Trail. Tucked away in the hills of northeastern Pennsylvania, the golf courses provide stunning scenery and views. All of the holes were carefully carved from the surrounding woodlands and molded into the hillsides. An abundance of trees characterizes the course, giving all of the holes a secluded feel that is further enhanced by the design, which doesn't feature any parallel fairways. The Trail/Blue Course combines the shortest and longest nines but both are considered slightly more challenging than the Ridge nine. The Trail nine possesses two of the four water holes at the club.

The heathlands layout feels like a links course with wind being an important factor and thick fescue coming into play. The golf course starts with an especially tough front nine but there are more scoring opportunities on the back. Mounded bunkers and moguls define the movement of the fairways and though there aren't many trees, if you don't keep your shots straight you might find yourself out-of-bounds or lost in the high, wiry grass. Sidehill lies await you as well as a few blind shots. Wyncote's greens have little undulation but the lightning fast putting surfaces are a challenge for players of all skill levels.

In addition to the golf course, Northampton Valley has a driving range with new range balls which is open to the public and a 10,000 sq. ft. practice green with a pristine sand trap for patrons to work on their short game.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/11931,,,,,,

The course originally opened in 1927. It has a classic design with traditional features including wide fairways, but the trees that line them have matured into quite the challenge. The 6,656-yard length may seem short by modern standards but don't get too comfortable. This mountain golf course features a variety of elevation changes and nowhere is this more apparent than the small greens where the breaks can vary from subtle to dramatic, but they are almost all unexpected. The greens also play lightning fast. Strategically placed bunkers are lurking throughout but thankfully water only comes into play on two holes.

There are also some straight, uphill holes that golfers will have to contend with on the back nine.

The course starts out mildly with a front nine that sprawls across gently undulating meadows while the back nine gets hillier and more challenging. There are more lakes and strategically placed bunkers that come into play on the back as well as a hidden brook that is just waiting for errant shots. Regent's Glen's 11th hole is one of the most intimidating, with a large lake along the fairway. If you dare to carry a portion of this hazard, you'll be rewarded with a shorter approach to the flagstick, however the hidden brook and deep bunker in front of the green will make that very difficult.

There is a mix of holes that are wide-open and some that are framed by stands of mature trees. The rolling terrain provides subtle but tricky undulations in the greens and fairways as well as the occasional double-tiered green.

His unwavering dedication to preserving the natural landscapes he works with is also apparent in the unspoiled beauty of the terrain. Hundreds of mature trees cover the golf course, which extends beyond 7,000 yards from the tips. The fairways twist around a series of lakes and streams and the subtly contoured greens can also be tricky. There are numerous bunkers strategically placed to create additional risk-reward options on every hole. Country Club of the North is a course that is challenging but fair.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1256,,,,,,

Surrounded by idyllic countryside, the golf course offers a serene atmosphere and a beautiful landscape that is ideal for golf. Although the yardage indicates the course as being a seemingly short 6,511 yards, the layout tends to play much longer due to the hilly terrain and narrow fairways lined with mature trees. The greens putt true and fast but they are known for their massive size. There are some that measure in at over 10,000 square feet. Proper placement is the key to this demanding layout. Hitting a strategic spot on the landing areas will require apt club choice off of the tee.

The rolling fairways are fairly wide but they are lined with mature trees and bunkers heavily guard the small, undulating greens. There are also water hazards that come into play on a number of holes. Delaware Golf Club's second hole is notably challenging, it is arguably the toughest hole on the front nine.

At nearly 7,300 yards, the layout is on the lengthier side. The golf course features tree-lined corridors that expand into ample fairways and the first noted use of Dye's signature railroad ties and pot bunkers.

The cathedral clock, still on display in the clubhouse, was presented by the participants of the 1920 U.S. Open, and Inverness was the first club to permit the players into the member’s clubhouse.

Opened in 1976, the layout may be more traditional than modern golf courses but it still presents one of the area's most formidable challenges. The course has hosted a variety of events over the years including the U.S. Open Qualifier and the South Carolina Amateur Championship.

Its defenses are numerous, from small, elevated greens to huge waste areas that surround plateaued fairways. New tees installed prior to the 2021 PGA Championship can stretch the layout to over 7,800 yards. For daily resort play, the Ocean Course is a walking-only layout that comes with caddies, with the exception of summer months after 10 a.m., when carts are permitted. It has been ranked within the Top 5 public golf courses in the country according to top magazine panels. Elevating the experience further is an oceanside driving range and putting green, as well as its iconic, lowcountry-inspired Ocean Course clubhouse, designed by Robert A.M. Stern architects. The 24,000-square-foot building features the Ryder Cup bar for casual dining and drinks as well as The Atlantic Room for fine dining. In 2021, Kiawah Island added four Ocean Course Cottages, each four-bedroom, 3,800-square-foot units that overlook the course. Accommodations at Kiawah Island include The Sanctuary Hotel as well as villas. Stay-and-play packages that include the Ocean Course an be booked with either option.",http://www.kiawahresort.com/?source=worldgolf,,,,,,

The golf course is just under 6,500 yards from the back tees, offering a good mix of length with some shorter holes. With water hazards coming into play on several holes as well as a good number of strategically placed bunkers, it is a course that will make you think. There are also a variety of elevation changes that are seemingly subtle but can cause more problems than you think. One particularly memorable hole is the first par 3 you reach on the front nine, which requires a forced carry over a pond.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12303,,,,,,

Sprawling across a lush landscape blanketed with century-old oaks and towering pines, the layout is as scenic as it is challenging. While the generous fairways may be player friendly, the difficult approaches to the elevated, well bunkered greens are anything but. The large, pristine white sand bunkers were designed in true Palmer-style, closely following the natural undulations of the land. The gently rolling terrain is unique for the area.

The course runs through the bottomlands of the Elm Fork Trinity River and is loaded with water due to a chain of interconnecting lakes created to collect heavy rains and irrigate the course. While there are no forced carries, water comes into play at least 12 holes, and out-of-bounds is a frequent concern because of the housing community that surrounds the course.No. 5 is the most difficult rated hole–a long dogleg right par 4 that requires a solid tee shot to be in position to reach the green in two. The approach is long and uphill into a severely back-to-front sloping green with a lake on the right and out-of-bounds and bunkers on the left.Two holes later, No. 7 is one of the toughest approaches in all of DFW. This hole plays due south into the prevailing wind, and the elevated green has a depth of only about 25 feet. Bunkers line the back, and the slope in front is significant. Ups and downs are difficult because of the slopes in the green. Take a look at the pin placement when you’re teeing off on No. 4.The good news is that other than out-of-bounds, the course is mostly wide open, so you’ll generally have a shot if you just miss the fairway. The only thick spot for trees is along the creek on holes 14-16.Getting there : Take the Belt Line exit off of 635 and drive north to MacArthur. Turn right (east) and drive to Riverchase Dr., where you’ll turn left. Look for the course on the right side of the road.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14579,,,,,,

And in addition to the hotel-business conference amenities, there’s the spectacular Tom Fazio route awaiting that is open for play only to resort guests and members of the adjoining Stonebriar Country Club.This place embodies Dallas’ northward surge. In the 1960s and 1970s, the new construction was further south in Richardson and Plano, when places like Preston Trails defined the suburbs’ northern edge. However, these days the edge is up this way in Frisco. On this once-barren, extremely flat farmland that served primarily as a hayfield lies the still reasonably flat Fazio track (although he moved over 600,000 yards of earth during construction) that is famous for its lightning-fast, Augusta-like putting surfaces. Made up of the new heat-resistant A-4 bentgrass that was installed recently at Fort Worth’s Colonial Country Club, these babies are certain three-jacks if you fail to pay attention to the pin placements with your approach.The greens are the signature at the Stonebriar, since Fazio’s layout is surprisingly hacker-friendly, mostly void of forced carries with fairways framed by mounds that seem to push the ball back into the fairway. The mounding also has a pleasing aesthetic purpose, making it impossible to see the neighboring fairways and greens.The best hole on the front is No. 2, a 407-yard doglegger that tees uphill over a wetland and involves an approach over a creek into a bunker-guarded green.On the back Fazio dropped in a 5-acre lake that comes into play on Nos. 11 and 14, both 400-yard-plus par 4s. Bunkers line the fairway on No. 11, and the hole doglegs right against the wind. Besides the lake on No. 14, the deep, multi-level green is the problem most likely to drive your score up.Getting there : From Hwy. 121 north, take the Legacy Ave. exit and west.

In fact, first-timers will be confused here. They’ll face intimidating views off the tee that leave doubt as to the problems that loom ahead, and it is definitely possible to lose all of your balls off the tee if you’re struggling.The golf course is just flat-out challenging, especially on the front nine.

The play here is to stay right and stay away from its subtle presence on the left side.

Two and half years later, the original nine holes opened. Construction on the next nine wrapped up in 2002, leaving 18 outstanding holes for the public.Tangle Oaks is an appropriate name. The course is carved out of an extremely dense oak thicket, sometimes referred to as “the shinnery.” In fact, the shinnery is so thick that it’s played as a lateral hazard– players just drop from where the ball went into the briar-patch-like rough. Length is not imperative, but accuracy is key. The greens are elevated, tilt from back to front, and have a medium to high slope.The fairways are quite tight, due to the oaks. The strategy is simple. Keep it straight or you'll get in trouble. Length is not important, but accuracy is a must.The signature hole is No. 9, a 383-yard par 4 that plays into the teeth of the stiff west Texas wind. To further a golfer's sheer terror, the green is completely fronted by water and a formidable retaining wall. On the back the most notable hole is No. 13, which features an island green. Hole 18 is unique because of the split fairway.Other notes: The county is dry, but Tangle Oaks allows you to bring your own beer.

After several attempts to reorganize the club, Solon Featherston bought the entire club, made many improvements (first bent-grass greens in North Texas), and brought the facility back to profitability–due in part to slot machines installed during his tenure.The layout features a good mixture of holes, with a creek winding its way through the course and coming into play on more than half of the holes.

Created with the aim of obtaining a major championship, the course opened in 2002 in an amazing spot just 6 miles southeast of downtown in old Oak Cliff.The land itself was once owned by a cement company that was unable to effectively use the land, and the city of Dallas refused to zone the area because of an escarpment that slices the landscape. Result: the perfect opportunity to use the terrain for golf. But this isn’t just your normal run-of-the-mill upscale daily-fee development. The big boys play here--guys like Tom Hicks and Roger Staubach--and the price tag is rumored to be upwards of $160,000 to become one of 350 members.The high price tag, Fazio name, superb location, and stunning landscape combine to make one of the highest-profile facilities that has ever graced the great state of Texas. Dallasites would be shocked to learn of the spectacular elevation changes that reside so close to their flat city. Tipping out at over 7,300 yards, the par 72 track spreads out over almost 400 acres of limestone canyons, winding creek beds, and large plateaus, with up to 160 feet of elevation changes.Every hole is a signature hole, with Fazio’s signature bunkers defining the immaculate zoysia fairways. The natural appearance of the course is accentuated by the subtle reddish-tan cart paths, and artistic wooden bridges span the limestone ravines.

Each hole offers a unique challenge, ensuring that you'll be using every club in your bag. The layout is on the shorter side but it makes up for any lack of length with a variety of other challenges. The golf course features narrow fairways and rolling greens framed by strategically placed bunkers.

It's a golf course where low handicappers can work on their skills in a no-pressure environment and high handicappers will be put to the test.

The other course, Eagles Pride, is located southwest of Whispering Firs. Designed by Bob Baldock in 1962, Whispering Firs opened on what was then McChord Air Force Base and later became part of Joint Base Lewis McChord. Though it's a military golf course, it's open to the public but don't forget to check in with security at the visitor's center. The layout features well manicured fairways lined with mature trees and challenging rough. The small greens demand accuracy and are made even more difficult with strategically placed bunkers framing the edges. There are some tough doglegs that require conservative play, and water hazards come into play as well. Whispering Firs Golf Club will test a variety of skills but it's not an overly punishing course. Players of all skill levels will be able to enjoy a round here.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13308,,,,,,

Macan, who contributed several notable courses throughout the Pacific Northwest including Firecrest in Tacoma and Broadmoor in Seattle. Sunland is known for its plush fairways and well manicured greens. The layout can be challenging if hitting straight isn't your strong suit.

The course is known for being one of the most scenic in Washington as well as one of the most playable. Though it's member owned, it's open to the public. Throughout the course you'll enjoy incredible views of the Hood Canal and Olympic Mountains. The layout is challenging but fair, offering a test of your skills without being overly punishing. Rolling fairways are lined with mature Evergreen trees and the large, fast greens make pin placement a challenge. The front nine is fairly tight but the golf course opens up on the back nine. Alderbrook's final hole is the layout's most memorable. Scoring par on this double-dogleg par 5 is something to be very proud of.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1664,,,,,,

Couples clearly favors traditional golf designs, as this one is pure old-school. A whopping six sets of tees allow just about anyone to enjoy the game at this exclusive club.The front side features the most difficult rated hole-the 473-yard No. 7, which tees over water and involves a tricky approach into a green protected by water left and back. The fairway snakes on No. 7, which creates some deceptive angles from which to approach the hole.On the back, Couples mixed it up well by offering an easier stretch of golf on holes 13-16, which consist of two relatively short par 4s and a pair of reasonable par 3s.Getting there : Take Beltway 8 south from I-10 to Westheimer.

The championship layout incorporates the plentiful water and woods of the natural terrain. The white sand bunkers that are strategically placed throughout add a beautiful contrast to the lush green of the golf course. The undulating terrain is one of the layout's most prominent features. Elaborate hills and greenside swales protect many of the putting complexes. The putting surfaces on the front nine are relatively calm when compared to the back nine where most of the greens are double-tiered, ridged, or layered. The par-4 15th is one of Stonebridge Golf Club's most scenic and challenging holes. With water in front, back, and right of the green, this is one of the toughest approaches on the back nine.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15148,,,,,,

The course has also been recognized as one of the 50 best public golf values in the country. The gently rolling hills of the landscape provide the course with rolling, tree-lined fairways and large, undulating greens, which are framed by strategically placed bunkers. Riverside is a challenging course but not so difficult that beginners should be intimidated. The classic layout is quite forgiving and versatile enough for a range of skill levels, one reason why it is the host to the Ray Fischer Tournament, one of the Midwest's most prestigious amateur events.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1708,,,,,,

It is scenic, challenging, well maintained and isn't as busy as most courses in Northern Utah.The reason that the course is not as busy is that it is a little more than an hour away from Salt Lake City and there isn't an Interstate running to it. But with the highway construction happening now in the city you can probably drive to Wolf Creek faster than you can across town.Wolf Creek is located in the rolling hills just below the canyon that leads to the Powder Mountain Ski Resort. The high mountains surround everything in sight and the area is very scenic. In addition to the golf course Wolf Creek includes condos and time share units for summer and winter vacationers.The course is a mountain style course with elevated tees, sloped terrain and lots of wild areas in which to lose your ball. Wildlife is often seen on the course including deer, moose and fox. A more common critter on the course is the garter snake. They are harmless but can give you a scare if you disturb one hiding hiding in the long grass.Wolf Creek is probably one of the top five toughest courses in Utah. It's tough because of it's playing length, not it's actual length. On the card, the tee lengths of 6845 (gold) and 6465 (blue) don't seem to be outrageous, but the way the holes use the yardage will make you think a 300 yard drive is required to score well.Several of the toughest par 4 holes in Utah are on Wolf Creek. Numbers 3, 7 and 18 are well over 400 yards long and each has an up sloping fairway to an elevated green. Long uphill second shots put fairway woods into the hands of all but the longest players. And once you reach the greens in regulation you still have to putt out on fast greens that break severely toward the valley bottom.Other long holes include the par 3s. All but one of them is in the 180+ range and two of them have long carries over water. The par 5s are the most manageable holes but even they have elevated greens making the holes play longer.The fairways are generally wider on the holes that require long tee shots, but all holes have plenty of places that provide lost and unplayable lies. The front 9 seems to be wide open as there are very few trees, but the long meadow grasses off the fairways will hide a ball as well as the thick woods on the back 9.Be cautious when driving from the elevated tees. Since the ball flies further after being hit from high above the landing area, the distance a miss-hit shot draws or fades will be exaggerated and you could end up missing the fairway. This is especially true on holes 1 and 10.Wolf Creek Golf Course is a tough challenge for the best golfers without being overly penal for mid handicap golfers. Beginners may find it over powering. Although the green fees are about $5 more than the average public course, Wolf Creek Golf resort offers a great value for the experienced golfer.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12779,,,,,,

The club is named after the four ancient oak trees that stood on the site when construction of the courses began in the 1960s. Unfortunately only one has been able to withstand the test of time, and golfers get a chance to admire this 450-year old tree on the second fairway of one of the golf course's nines.

The club gets its name from the land's former use, a raspberry field. The scenic terrain overlooks to Catoctin Mountains and there are still a few raspberry bushes dotting the course. By far the layout's most formidable challenges come from the deep, stacked pot bunkers that make it truly feel like a classic Scottish golf course. There are also water hazards on a few holes. The course's signature is the par-4 third hole, which is long but plays downhill all the way. The 10th hole, another par 4, is one of the toughest. The landing area is generous off the tee but there is a creek and pond to the left and fairway bunkers on the right.",http://www.raspberryfalls.com/,,,,,,

The golf course will reward creative shot-making and thoughtful strategy but it is not overly punishing for the high handicapper. The rolling terrain provides plenty of challenging ups and downs throughout and there are many water holes, including the memorable ninth, a short par 4 with an island green. Cypress Creek Golfers' Club even has its own ""amen corner"" that starts with the par-4 15th, moves on to the waterlogged 16th, and finishes with another par 4, an uphill hole that is the toughest of the trio.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13140,,,,,,

The pristine white bunkers and the lush fairways contrast nicely with the trees. The course conveniently sits just 30 miles from the Washington Beltway. In 2011 when the golf course was acquired by Raspberry Golf Management, who are responsible for several courses in the area, Augustine underwent major renovations that increased its playability. The greens, fairways, rough, bunkers, and tee boxes were all redone. The layout offers a challenge but is gentle enough for beginners to approach with confidence. Included in a round of golf at Augustine are range balls and unlimited use of the driving range, which has different targets and a large putting green.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15027,,,,,,

The fairways are edged with saltwater marshes and Jones included his signature sculpted bunkers along the greensides. Just a stone's throw from the ocean, the golf course is as scenic as it is challenging.

The resort boasts two championship courses, the Brute and the Highlands. The formidable Brute Course stretches to over 7,000 yards. It is considered one of the toughest golf courses in the Midwest. The layout wanders across rolling terrain, incorporating a variety of elevation changes that range from subtle to dramatic. There are 68 bunkers strategically placed along the massive, undulating greens. The course is aptly named since it will relentlessly test your skills. It is more challenging than the Highlands, which is a links course designed by Jack Nicklaus and Pete Dye. In addition to the two courses, Grand Geneva Resort & Spa also has a practice facility complete with a driving range and putting and chipping greens.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1709,,,,,,

The course wanders across lush, gently rolling countryside that is studded with stands of mature trees. Meandering streams come into play, as do strategically placed bunkers.

There are also a few streams that meander across the landscape. Rivermoor Golf Club is a proud member of the Audubon Sanctuary System. Beyond providing a secluded setting and great scenery, the terrain also makes for a challenging round. The trees frame most of the holes and water hazards come into play on a few holes. There are also strategically placed bunkers with which to contend.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13902,,,,,,

The course originally opened in 1927 as a nine-holer but was renovated and lengthened in the 1980s but the front nine wasn't added until 2004. Only a few holes remained from the original nine-hole course, but they play just as they did in the 20s. The newer front nine has a link-style design that demands accuracy off the tee with 29 sand traps strategically placed throughout the nine holes. There are a variety of other hazards as well. As you move onto the back nine, the golf course's character changes completely. The holes have a traditional design and they are much more wooded with mature trees framing almost every hole, just waiting to knock down an errant tee shot or missed approach.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13909,,,,,,

The championship Oaks is a challenging but straightforward layout. You can play it well the first time you play it, so long as you are able to keep it in the short grass. Strategically placed sand traps come into play along many of the greens and there are water hazards on four holes.

Major golf publications including Golf Digest have hailed Castlegar as one of the best courses to play in Canada, especially for the value. The layout's most challenging hole is the par-4 ninth, which requires not only two long shots in order to reach the green, but the approach also has to be well placed to even have a chance at a birdie or par.

A royal visit by then Princess Elizabeth in 1951 is a highlight of its storied past. Several of the original buildings from the estate are protected and are still in use today.Possessing a variety of challenges over its eighteen fairways, the first three holes are fairly open and introduce you gently to this lush, park-like course. Difficulty arises quickly from the fourth tee box, where a rather narrow landing area awaits big hitters, with water on the left and out of bounds on the right. Laying up with a long iron is the sensible play here. The middle holes wind through fir and cedar-lined fairways, with a variety of doglegs and ponds to keep you focused. The par five fourteenth at 509 yards from the whites is a challenge not to be taken lightly. Lined by lakes on both sides, with a huge pot bunker guarding the green, you’ll do well to make par here. The 403-yard seventeenth is also a test with its undulating fairways and slippery four-tiered green.After your round, be sure to visit the historic clubhouse, 9,000 square feet and built from hand-hewn logs.

The second nine wasn't added until a decade later, lengthening the course to just over 6,700 yards. The golf course stretches across what was once the site of an old mine. The terrain is mostly flat, making it an easy golf course to walk but also subjecting it to the wind. On blustery days, the course can be especially tricky. The front nine, known among regulars as the ""Country Club Nine,"" has more trees than the back but it has a more player-friendly nature that will appeal to beginners. Taber Golf Club's challenging back nine will have you using every club in your bag to maneuver the twisting doglegs and subtle contours.

The 18-hole golf course stretches to just over 6,900 yards from the back tees. It is a great course for long hitters but it also forces golfers to employ creative strategies on each hole. The layout is tight in some spots and thanks to the interconnected lakes, water hazards come into play on several holes.

The greens are severely sloped and they play lightning fast. More often than not, you'll find that they're flanked by strategically placed bunkers as well. There are also water hazards that come into play on several holes.

The layout has a nice variety of holes including lengthy par 5s, tricky par 3s, and par 4s that offer birdie opportunities. Elmwood Golf Club also offers an expansive driving range with both indoor and outdoor bays.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/16643,,,,,,

It offers two 18-hole golf courses and one nine-hole course. Dick Wilson originally designed the Blue Course in 1958, but in 2004 Rees Jones did a complete renovation. Jones reshaped all of the course's greens, creating several with multiple tiers, and he also rebuilt many of the tees, which are all now square. The fairways and greenside bunkers were completely reconstructed as well to provide a greater challenge. The signature hole is the par-4 16th, which poses a formidable threat since it plays right into prevailing wind. The 14th is also memorable for its treacherous water hazard.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/28155,,,,,,

The layout is considered one of the toughest in the province. The elevation changes throughout the course offer scenic mountain views but they also guarantee that a flat lie will be hard to find.

The tree-lined fairways and heavily bunkered greens carefully follow the natural undulation of the landscape, featuring a good amount of elevation changes that often cause the ball the break in a different direction than what you're expecting. Mount Bruno's signature hole is the par-4 13th, which sits at the highest point on the course, offering a spectacular view of the surrounding valley.

And while it’s part of a gated, active-adult residential community, the course is open to the public and especially fun because it integrates well with the neighborhood. Houses line some fairways, but a fair number of holes provide that natural, rural feel that is always so welcome on a golf course.While the course is not particularly demanding off the tees, the real challenge at Heritage Ranch comes from the mound-shaped greens. If your irons aren’t dialed in, you’ll be working hard for ups and downs.No. 1 is a unique opener because it bends left down to a fairway and green that aren’t visible from the tee. Big drives can get close, but the recommended play is to take a long iron and draw it over the hill.The par 5s on the front are nice holes. No. 3 doglegs right and requires a good tee shot, followed by a relatively easy second shot into a widening fairway toward the hole. The trick is nailing the short iron (almost a blind shot) into the elevated green guarded by bunkers on the front. No. 7 is longer and offers a good chance for birdie, again because of its wide-open nature.No. 16 is the signature hole: a par 3 masterpiece that plays along a natural spring waterfall. You’ll need to nail a long iron over the valley and avoid the trees that overhang the fairway from the right.No. 18 is a good finisher–it’s a long par 4 that doglegs left around a few large fairway bunkers, then works its way uphill to an elevated, mound-shaped green surrounded by bunkers. Ups and downs are possible here if you miss the green back left, which is easy to do when you approach with a fairway wood.Getting there : Only 20 miles northeast of Dallas, take I-75 north to the Stacy Road exit, then turn right and drive to the dead end. The road jogs to the left, then right, and continues as Stacy Road. The entrance is 2 miles down on the left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/22891,,,,,,

The hilly terrain is as scenic as it is challenging, providing some tricky uneven lies and there is a meandering creek that slithers along the fairways. Though it's wide open, the golf course requires a bit of accuracy and some good course management. The elevated tees offer some spectacular views as well as some intimidating approaches to the fast, undulating greens.

The golf course measures just over 6,900 yards from the back tees. There are four tees total and they are diverse enough for players of any skill level to play to their ability. Tall evergreens line the fairways and they also border the numerous ponds and wetlands that are scattered throughout the golf course.

There are a few challenges spread throughout, including a fair number of bunkers bordering the greensides. Its forgiving nature and risk-reward opportunities make it a great place for golf tournaments as well.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/27718,,,,,,

Every hole has a different feel to it, which guarantees plenty of variety throughout the course. The nine-hole layout is diverse enough to appeal to players of all skill levels. It's challenging enough for advanced players while still being gentle enough for beginners. There are several memorable holes, including the par-5 fifth, which is a tricky double dogleg and the par-3 seventh, which is almost entirely enclosed by water. Sandy Row Golf Club is great for a quick round, but another advantage of the split-tee system is that it allows the course to be played like an 18-hole course, where golfers are confronted with a different tee shot the second time around.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/27858,,,,,,

The DGV Golf & Nature certificate in silver confirms this success.A varied round of golf awaits you on a course that will give you a lot of pleasure, but also requires a tactical game.We hope you have a great game!",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/31043,,,,,,

Past the beautiful things, you walk along the oak grove to the clubhouse - in true half-timbered style.A friendly welcome, perhaps a quick purchase in the pro shop, and then you can start your round. The precise allocation of starting times - even during the week - means there is no crowding at the tee.After a few strokes on the driving range and a few skillful chips and putts, you head to the first tee. You get a first impression of the course at tee 1: a dogleg to the right over meadows means that many a short tiger line drive disappears among the Heidschnucken. Precise play is required across the entire course, scattered drives quickly end up in the dense forest, in the numerous bunkers and lakes. A course that is certainly difficult; played tactically, however, it is an absolute must for every golfer. Add to that the beautiful heath landscape through which the 18 completely differently designed holes with their well-kept fairways and greens run. After the game, you can relax wonderfully on the club terrace with a view of the course. Anyone who wants to can join one another at the long tables. The boss is also always up for a chat. He is happy to talk about the beginnings at the club, the daily maintenance of the course or give tips for your own game.A successful day of golf is coming to an end - a shame, actually, some holes could certainly have been played differently...",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/31322,,,,,,

The Machrie's main claim to fame is its own Open Championship of 1901, which included the Great Triumvirate of Harry Vardon, John Henry Taylor and James Braid.At 6,782 yards, Machrie's length is modest by today's standards, but that doesn't detract from the challenge it musters.

The inward 9 holes carry fewer hazards but the Findon burn continues to create problems at the fifteenth and eighteenth.Arguably the fifteenth is the 'signature hole' of the course. First, the tee shot has to be accurate to cope with the right to left dog leg and then the approach shot, from a down hill lie, has to carry the Findon burn which, moat like, guards the entrance to the green. The par 507 yd par 5 eighteenth is a challenging closing hole featuring a drystone dyke on the left running all the way from tee to green with the risk of out of bounds with even' shot. The Findon burn. 1(K) yards short of the green creates a further dilemma of second shot selection; to carry or not to carry.Senior golfers and visitors normally play the shorter par 70 'Blue Tee' course.Course development has seen the planting of around 21.000 carefully selected trees, restoration of drystone dykes. construction of stone bridges, new tees at several holes and a pond at the short fifth. There is an extensive practice area, part of which is the site of approved plans to build a 15 bay driving range. The substantial putting green is conveniently sited near the first tee.

This monster doglegs left inside a cliff that runs along the right side. Out-of-bounds is left, and a fairway bunker resides about a lob wedge from the narrow green, which is bolstered from behind by more bunkers.No. 18 is one of the more interesting finishing holes that you’ll come across, featuring two dogleg fairways, one right and one left, that both involve dealing with the creek that splits the two routes. The tee shot right is more favorable, since it is void of fairway bunkers like the ones on the left side. However, this option involves carrying two bunkers and the creek on the approach.Getting there : From I-20 west, take the Bryant/Irvin Rd. exit and turn left. Drive 2.5 miles to the course.

The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times. Other multiple winners of this longstanding PGA Tour event include Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Nick Price and Ben Crenshaw.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/21496,,,,,,

Ten years later, two holes from the original Thomas/Bell layout that were lost during a redesign following WWII were completely restored and incorporated into the layout. The challenging golf course is very narrow in some spots and it features undulating greens that putt fast and true.

The former is the short 6th hole, with a pot bunker in the middle of the sweeping, multi-tiered green. The latter: the 10th, whose broad fairway and strategic bunkering gives way to one of the toughest-to-hit putting surfaces in the world. Even the best golfers in the world routinely make scores from 2 to 8 there.In addition to the PGA Tour’s annual Genesis Invitational, Riviera has a considerable major championship pedigree, including a U.S. Open (1948) and two PGA Championships (1983, 1995).",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14936,,,,,,

The par-72 North is considerably longer and more difficult than the par-71 South. The North features multiple doglegs and strategically placed sand traps that will test even the most experienced players. To make the golf course a bit more approachable, water hazards don't play a prominent role, though they do appear on a few holes, and the forward tees are very player friendly.

The result was nothing less than spectacular as bunkers and greens were to returned original specifications with modern turf and drainage technology.

The par-70 layout is player friendly enough for beginners but low handicappers will also find it to be a fun round. The holes are fairly straightforward though there are some fairways that have very narrow landing areas that will test the accuracy of even the best golfers. Numerous bunkers are strategically placed along the undulating greens and water also comes into play on the occasional hole. The golf course starts out gently but becomes progressively more challenging on the back nine. The most memorable hole on the golf course, the par-3 12th, is a water hole that features an intimidating island green.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/4447,,,,,,

It's no surprise that water has a prominent role on the course. It comes into play on 14 holes on this challenging 18-hole layout, which is considered one of the area's best. The course is also home to an abundance of wildlife that includes several different bird species, deer, fox, otters, and even alligators. The front nine starts off gently with a more traditional design but it's the back nine, which weaves through beautiful wetlands, that will test your accuracy. River Pointe Golf Club's signature hole is the par-5 14th. This lengthy hole has water all along the left side and in front of the green, which slopes from back to front. A perfectly placed ball will be rewarded with a chance for a birdie.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/4517,,,,,,

The front nine has a wide-open links-style layout that provides an interesting contrast to the back nine, which is characterized by tree-lined, narrow fairways. The greens are large and undulating and sometimes framed with strategically placed bunkers. The golf course winds through scenic coastal marshes and wetlands, which come into play on 13 holes.

The golf course has a traditional Scottish links design that also incorporates a few mountain holes. It's a layout that will always keep you guessing. It may not be the most formidable golf course in the area, but it shouldn't be underestimated either. The course strikes a good balance between being forgiving enough for high handicappers and challenging enough for more advanced players. The par 3s are tough and the diverse par 4s come in all shapes and sizes. Royal Lakes Golf & C.C. is a shot maker's layout that requires accuracy and thoughtful strategy.

The two hired the eclectic Scotsman Desmond Muirhead to design the course on 190 acres of former cotton fields.In the 1980s, the LPGA and Senior PGA tours frequently hosted tournaments at Bent Tree, and the course was eventually renovated in 1990. The improvements focused on the front nine (which is still more open than the back), spicing up the layout with bunkering, tree additions, and adjustments to greens.Water comes into play on 14 of 18 holes, and the course is quite long if you play from the tips. The best hole on the front is No. 3, a long par 5 that plays almost 600 yards. The narrow fairway chutes between water on the left and bunkers on the right, and the small green slopes severely to the water on the left side.The more interesting back nine offers a nice stretch of golf on holes 13-15. No. 14 is the most scenic on the course because it plays downhill at least 75 feet to a green surrounded on three sides by water. The 387-yard 18th is the perfect finishing hole–not too long but plenty challenging.Getting there : From I-635 east, take the Dallas North Tollway and exit Westgrove.

Water hazards come into play on a few holes and towering trees line the fairways. The greens are fast and the rough can be punishing.

The greens often feature slopes and undulations but they are fair and they roll true. They are also known for being excellently maintained. Mature trees frame many of the holes and there are several strategically placed bunkers lurking throughout. Water doesn't come into play too often but the elevation changes will provide plenty of challenges.

There is only one water hazard that comes into play, but it still manages to add a lot of character. The views spanning across Lake Isabella are almost enough of a reason to play the golf course.

For example, a well executed shot placed near a hazard is rewarded with less club to the green or a better approach angle, or even both. The putting surfaces have gentle transitions to different pin locations, making them more traditional than modern. The designers incorporated another classic design element, the greens have subtle roll-offs or collars that fall away, a feature of golf courses from the 1930s and 40s.

The course has a classic design with an interesting mix of holes that range from being wide open to narrow and tree lined. The postage-stamp-sized greens demand accuracy and there are also a few strategically placed bunkers lurking along the greensides. Build up your score on the front nine before tackling the tougher back nine. The golf course has enough challenges to keep more advanced players satisfied but it's forgiving enough to appeal to beginners as well. One of the most memorable holes is the par-3 13th. There is a tree that stands right in the middle of the fairway, forcing you to either go over or try to get around and risk going in the sand trap.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1863,,,,,,

One of the trickier holes is the par-5 17th, which is almost completely surrounded by water. The layout has a few challenging holes but overall a range of skill levels can play the golf course.

While Howard established a reputation for basic, down-and-dirty courses in the 60s and 70s, this modern, challenging track is more of a complete golf experience.The design incorporates numerous water hazards, including many natural ponds that grace the rolling terrain. The fairways are fairly generous, and most of the greens have deceptive undulations.During the round you’ll notice the long, challenging par 4s. Particularly the 405 yard No. 11, where a creek cuts into the fairway twice, framing the landing area off the tee. No. 3 is also tough, playing 446 yards and forcing another carry of a creek that cuts into the fairway. The 17th is another solid par 4–not as long, but picturesque because the green is completely surrounded by water.Finally, the feature that rounds out the experience at Wildflower is the great condition of the course, enhanced by the new irrigation system that keeps the fairways lush and the greens healthy and rolling true.Getting there : From I-35 north, exit Midway Drive and turn left.

His dream eventually became a peaceful retirement community with a beautiful 18-hole course as its centerpiece. The Arthur Hills-designed layout is one of the toughest par-60 golf courses in southwest Florida. There are two streams that cut across the course and intersect on the front nine. They snake along every hole, making water the predominant hazard but there are also several strategically placed bunkers to watch out for. The golf course is mostly open with a few cypress trees dotted along the fairways and greens. Myerlee Golf & C.C. is a course that will test your skills but it isn't overly punishing, which gives it appeal for beginners as well.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15484,,,,,,

The rolling fairways are often wide and generous off the tee and the sand dunes, which stretch from tee too green, are only punishing of the most errant of shots. The approach shots though are as demanding as the tee shots are forgiving. There are numerous bunkers fiercely guarding the large, smooth greens.

The layout is a favorite among seniors for its walkability and it's also a great spot for families since it's a player-friendly round for all skill levels.

To make up for the damages caused by Hurricane Andrew, the golf course has been outfitted with replanted tall live oak and palm trees that can affect shots. There are also nearly 100 sand bunkers present on the course. The Melreese course's signature hole is the par-4 14th, which is nicknamed ""Heartbreak Ridge."" It has water alongside the right side of the fairway all the way from the tee to the green, and it requires an approach shot past water to an island green.

The course is player enough for beginners and while it may not be what you're looking for if you're in search of a formidable test, it's good for some casual practice for the more advanced player. The layout balances player-friendly, wide fairways with greens that are guarded by strategically placed bunkers. There is a series of lakes and streams throughout the golf course that come into play on nearly every hole. The golf course has seen several improvements since it first opened in 1969, especially after it was badly damaged from a hurricane. More than 200 trees were added as well as 1,200 grasses and shrubs. Hibiscus Golf Club also has a driving range and putting green.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14030,,,,,,

The terrain has a few subtle undulations but overall it is mostly flat, making it an enjoyable course for walkers.

The challenging golf course once served as a host site for the US Open Qualifying Rounds. Water hazards come into play as well as several strategically placed bunkers. Although seasoned golfers are kept on their toes, the layout is more still approachable thank to four different sets of tees.

The improvements focused on the front nine (which is still more open than the back), spicing up the layout with bunkering, tree additions, and adjustments to greens.Water comes into play on 14 of 18 holes, and the course is quite long if you play from the tips. The best hole on the front is No. 3, a long par 5 that plays almost 600 yards. The narrow fairway chutes between water on the left and bunkers on the right, and the small green slopes severely to the water on the left side.The more interesting back nine offers a nice stretch of golf on holes 13-15.

Water hazards also come into play on a few holes. The golf course is challenging enough for avid players yet forgiving enough for high handicappers to approach with confidence. It's a player-friendly layout that is great for beginners and seniors. Though the golf course may not require distance, your short game skills will be put to the test.

The undulating, tree-lined fairways were designed to mimic a hilly New England course but the moss-covered cypresses, palm trees, and marshy swamplands are true to the Florida landscape. The layout features tight fairways framed with contoured mounding and the occasional water hazard but the most formidable challenge comes from the bunkers strategically placed along the undulating greens. The approaches to the tiered greens, which are often sloped from back to front, demand accuracy.

To commemorate 40 years of great golf, the course was remodeled and revamped in 2002. The renovations improved its playability and also made it more challenging. The championship-caliber layout features strategically placed bunkers, including some Scottish-style sod-faced ones, and tricky water hazards on several holes. The hilly terrain offers both challenging elevation changes and scenic views. The golf course finishes with a long par 5 that plays across a canyon of berms to a narrow fairway. Further accuracy is needed to reach the well guarded green surrounded by high berms, a pot bunker to the left, and a deep, steep bunker to the right. In addition to the course, Makray Memorial G.C. boasts an extensive practice facility with 1 1/2 acres of grass teeing ground, two putting greens, and a short-game area.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15996,,,,,,

Though the design of the layout has fluctuated, Crab Orchard is known among locals for consistently offering superb conditions. The scenic golf course features lush fairways winding through stands of mature oak trees. Water hazards come into play on half of the holes and the small greens have subtle breaks, which can make them difficult to read. The golf course is quite formidable from the championship tees but the forward and middle tees make it approachable for all skill levels. In addition to the course, a popular feature at Crab Orchard is the large driving range which boasts target greens and a practice bunker.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/5086,,,,,,

In addition, more than 10,000 railroad ties were used to create another classic Dye design.

The fairways are generous and forgiving though. The course is a fair test but it is especially tough on windy days. The interior, tree-lined holes contrast nicely with the waterfront holes and they have the added benefit of protection from the prevailing sea breezes.

Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

The golf course demands a fair amount of accuracy but it's not overly punishing if you're errant.

Pete Dye and his son P.B. collaborated to design the course, making it the only Dye design in the Chicago area. A well thought-out strategy will be greatly rewarded on this challenging layout and bad shots made without any thought will be severely punished. This is definitely not a golf course where you can just grip it and rip it. The fairways are fairly straight and forgiving, but most of the approach shots play to tricky elevated greens. There are also strategically placed bunkers framing the greens and water hazards come into play on several holes as well.

Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3302,,,,,,

The course originally opened in 1927 as a nine-holer but was renovated and lengthened in the 1980s but the front nine wasn't added until 2004. Only a few holes remained from the original nine-hole course, but they play just as they did in the 20s. The newer front nine has a link-style design that demands accuracy off the tee with 29 sand traps strategically placed throughout the nine holes. There are a variety of other hazards as well. As you move onto the back nine, the golf course's character changes completely. The holes have a traditional design and they are much more wooded with mature trees framing almost every hole, just waiting to knock down an errant tee shot or missed approach.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13909,,,,,,

The course is nestled amongst mature native trees, running adjacent to the Great Miami River, which comes into play on a few holes. It is considered one of the best nine-hole golf courses in the Greater Dayton and Cincinnati area with a reputation built on its consistently good conditions Although it is short at just under 2,600 yards, there are sculpted bunkers that pack as much of a punch as any full-length course. The course is a great option for a quick round that still offers a challenge.

The par-72 course that exists today tumbles across a variety of elevation changes that range from subtle to dramatic. The golf course is mostly wide open, putting it at the mercy of the prevailing winds. On particularly blustery days, Crystal Woods Golf Club is quite demanding. The 12th is the course’s signature and it even has a reputation for being the most difficult hole in McHenry County.

The golf course has a classic design that stretches to just over 6,000 yards from the back tees. Though the holes may seem short by modern standards, you'll soon find out that they require thought and will test your shot-making skills.

The layout is much like playing two golf courses in one with a front nine that is tightly lined with trees and a hillier back nine that wraps around a large lake. There are also a few small ponds that come into play on the front nine. The rolling terrain guarantees uneven lies as well as the occasional blind shot.

Bendelow designed 800-plus North American courses, working with land he was assigned: In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, architects didn't get their turf, rocks and water features trucked in. Born Sept. 2, 1868, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bendelow began golfing when he was 9 years old, with his dad at the Balgownie Links, which now goes by Royal Aberdeen Golf Club - founded in 1780, Royal Aberdeen Golf Club is the world's sixth-oldest, and it's clear that Bendelow had rich inspiration to draw on back in Scotland.After a round of golf at the Western Hills Country Club, head back to the Grill Porch for nibbles and sips.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10555,,,,,,

Oak Hurst is also well known for its large, well-bunkered, undulating greens and water that comes into play on over half of the holes.The number-one-rated hole is No. 10, a challenging 595-yard par 5 that welcomes golfers who’ve allowed their concentration to wane at the turn. However, the most-talked-about hole is the par 4 16th, which plays around 400 yards and has been rated by the East Texas pros as the most difficult in the region.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2797,,,,,,

Bendelow designed 800-plus North American courses, working with land he was assigned: In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, architects didn't get their turf, rocks and water features trucked in. Born Sept. 2, 1868, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bendelow began golfing when he was 9 years old, with his dad at the Balgownie Links, which now goes by Royal Aberdeen Golf Club - founded in 1780, Royal Aberdeen Golf Club is the world's sixth-oldest, and it's clear that Bendelow had rich inspiration to draw on back in Scotland.After a round of golf at the Western Hills Country Club, head back to the Grill Porch for nibbles and sips.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10555,,,,,,

Dennis Griffiths, the course's architect, seamlessly blended the design with the natural features of the landscape. The abundant natural water hazards come into play on half the holes and Griffiths strategically incorporated several well placed bunkers. The terrain's gentle undulations provide some interesting slope in the greens that place a priority on accuracy. Bent Tree Golf Club's par-4 eighth hole is especially demanding. It may be short at only 334 yards but it is surrounded by bunkers on all sides. It is followed by another tricky par 4 that requires both distance and accuracy in order to navigate the tree-lined fairway uphill to an undulating green faced with bunkers to the front and back.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1310,,,,,,

The course is situated amid the Sierra Foothills, tumbling across a picturesque desert landscape sprinkled with native flora. The layout has many risk-reward opportunities and the par-3 holes are especially fun. The hilly terrain is as scenic as it is challenging, providing some tricky uneven lies and there is a meandering creek that slithers along the fairways. Though it's wide open, the golf course requires a bit of accuracy and some good course management. The elevated tees offer some spectacular views as well as some intimidating approaches to the fast, undulating greens. In addition to the golf course, Wolf Run also has a practice facility with a driving range and putting and chipping greens.

Pro golfers such as Tommy Bolt, Charles Coody, Don Cherry, Mike Standly, and Bob Estes have all spent time here.The fairways are generous and the layout is loaded with bunkers. The track’s first hole of note is the beautiful 360-yard par 4 No. 5, which doglegs left. Locals aim at the three oaks on the right side of the fairway and work their draw. The most difficult hole is the 390-yard par 4 ninth hole, which plays uphill into the wind with an approach that must carry water. Hole 14 (190 yards) is also tough, requiring a long iron with the wind–which makes it impossible at times to hold the green, and is especially treacherous with water front and left of the green.Getting there : From I-20 west, exit 83/84 and take the Buffalo Gap exit.

Dennis Griffiths, the course's architect, seamlessly blended the design with the natural features of the landscape. The abundant natural water hazards come into play on half the holes and Griffiths strategically incorporated several well placed bunkers. The terrain's gentle undulations provide some interesting slope in the greens that place a priority on accuracy. Bent Tree Golf Club's par-4 eighth hole is especially demanding. It may be short at only 334 yards but it is surrounded by bunkers on all sides. It is followed by another tricky par 4 that requires both distance and accuracy in order to navigate the tree-lined fairway uphill to an undulating green faced with bunkers to the front and back.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1310,,,,,,

The fairways are of standard width and are lined by mature trees, but what you’ll remember after your round are the extremely small greens. If you can nail the approach shots, it’s pretty much birdies galore here because the course is short and doesn’t offer up too many hazards.On the front, the most difficult hole is the long par 5 No. 9, which plays 572 yards from the back. The back nine, like the front, is loaded with short par 3s that play from 300 to 350 yards.Getting there : From Hwy. 75, take Hwy. 84 west to the course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2874,,,,,,

The golf course is interwoven with a meandering creek that is connected to three ponds, all of which come into play on several holes throughout the course. The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings. Meadowbrook C.C. has hosted several events over the years, including numerous Wisconsin state opens.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1750,,,,,,

No matter who you talk to in the DFW area, they all seem to praise the superb condition of the course from tee to green. Offering a 7,078-yard par 71 Jay Morrish/Tom Weiskopf design, Buffalo Creek offers a good combination of holes: straight holes, dogleggers, uphill and downhill shots, and both long and short holes.One of the best features is the club’s method of using a pin location sheet to mark exactly where each pin is located on a particular day (up to six locations), which is unbelievably helpful to hacks who’ve never played the course before and have no feel for the look and contour of the greens.Getting there : Take I-30 east from Dallas and exit Ridge Rd. Turn right and find the course 1.6 miles down on the left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3274,,,,,,

The golf course has a traditional desert landscape but the stunning mountain views elevate it to a truly unique experience. The course has a classic design that is player friendly enough for beginners and even gentle enough juniors. It may not be what you're looking for if you want a formidable test, but more advanced players will appreciate it for a quick casual round. It's also great for working on your short game skills. The golf course is short and tight with immaculately manicured greens. You won't find much water at Woodhaven Country Club except on the 17th, which seems like its nearly all water.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3907,,,,,,

The golf course also enjoys panoramic views of the Sacramento Valley. Massive rock outcroppings border the fairways, calling for some creative shot making. Accuracy is also a necessity with meandering creeks and bunkers coming into play on most holes. The layout is challenging but five sets of tees make the golf course approachable for a variety of skill levels. Winchester G.C. is not only well known throughout northern California, it has also been ranked as one of the 15 best in the state.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/188,,,,,,

They persevered with their idea and eventually established an 18-hole, par-72 course right in Cumberland Center. The golf course has a traditional layout that is heavily lined with trees. Accuracy is an important part of the round but if you can manage to hit straight, you'll have a good game. Strategically placed bunkers also lurk along the greensides and fairways. In addition to the golf course, there is a driving range and practice green. Val Halla Golf & Recreation Center is a scenic and more affordable alternative to other options in Portland.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/6821,,,,,,

Shorty was a hacker and his short course is designed to accommodate the lesser golfer with its executive-like 2,385-yard length.Plaster's design opens up with three par 3s, followed by another on No. 5. Every par 4 plays 350 yards or less, and the sole par 5 is only 475 yards. Not many non-par-3 9-holers are blessed with lights, but this one is. The same goes for the driving range, so you can definitely spend some hours at this nice little country course.Getting there : From I-45 south, exit Dixie Farm Rd. and turn right. Drive 8 miles to where it dead-ends, then turn on Hwy 35. Drive 8 miles to Fairway Dr. and turn left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2726,,,,,,

Be sure to build up your score on the player-friendly first half because greater accuracy will be required for the final stretch of the golf course. With plenty of variety among all of the holes, the layout will test your skill with different types of shots. There are a variety of elevation changes ranging from subtle to dramatic, providing tricky uphill and downhill lies.

Nestled in the rolling hills of central Main, the golf course runs alongside the river that created its namesake valley. The scenic landscape is covered with mature trees, which are concentrated along the undulating fairways. The original design was slightly tweaked in 2001 to make it both more challenging and more playable. The green sizes were reduced and bunkers were shifted or removed. The result was a golf course that is challenging enough for more advanced players but still gentle enough for beginners to approach with confidence. The classic elements of Ross' design still manage to shine though, which has cemented Penobscot Valley Country Club's status as a Maine tradition.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/6862,,,,,,

Having two different designers gives the golf course plenty of variety, especially since the holes are intermingles. Cornish's greens are bigger and flatter while the Ross holes feature some of his characteristic greens and bunkers. Water hazards come into play as well and you'll face a few tricky doglegs and blind shots. There are some challenging holes but overall it's not an overly difficult golf course. The average player can still approach it with confidence. With a secluded location in rural western Massachusetts, Ellinwood Country Club offers beautiful views of the surrounding countryside. The 11th hole, with a winding brook that runs alongside the fairway before cutting in front of the green, is particularly scenic.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/7039,,,,,,

The undulating terrain provides gently sloped greens and elevated tees from which there are scenic views of the surrounding countryside. The golf course has a links-style layout that will appeal to a variety of different skill levels. The ample greens vary in shape and the player-friendly fairways have generous landing areas. There are six ponds that come into play on half of the holes as well as nearly 40 strategically placed sand bunkers throughout. The course's signature hole is the par-4 ninth hole. This tricky hole features water along the right side of the fairway and green and out-of-bounds stakes along the left, as well as a large sand bunker lurking treacherously behind the green.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10725,,,,,,

There have been many changes over the years, including opening to the public in 1965 and the addition of another nine holes in 1974. At just over 6,000 yards, it's a short course by modern standards but it's no pushover. The greens are known for being challenging and they are also some of the truest and smoothest putting surfaces you'll find in the area. Though length may not be required, accuracy and course management are essential. The hazards at Marshfield C.C. are mostly provided by the existing landscape, including the meandering creeks, mature trees, and rocky outcroppings, which are complemented by several strategically placed bunkers. Each hole offers a different test, beginning with a tough par 4. This dogleg left hole has a stream that cuts right through the center.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13737,,,,,,

The club underwent yet another multi-million dollar renovation in 2012 when the club changed ownership. In the most recent renovation, hundreds of extraneous trees were cleared from the fairways in order to get it back into pristine condition. Although it's a seemingly short layout at just over 6,200 yards from the back tees, it actually plays much longer. The first two holes are laid across the hilliest portion of the terrain.

Originally designed by Donald Ross in 1898, the golf course is one of Ohio's oldest and it stands as one of the most original and unaltered Ross designs in the country. At just over 6,684 yards, the classic layout runs a bit shorter than most courses built today. It is a challenging layout but it is also very forgiving, making it more accommodating for beginning and intermediate players. The club has built its longstanding reputation on the player-friendly Ross design and the excellent course conditions, cementing it as one of the area's favorites. Besides golf, Springfield Country Club also offers an Olympic-sized swimming pool with a slide and six tennis courts.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10991,,,,,,

The greens are severely sloped and they play lightning fast. More often than not, you'll find that they're flanked by strategically placed bunkers as well. There are also water hazards that come into play on several holes. The golf course appeals to a wide range of skill levels since it's not overly punishing for high handicappers and there are risk-reward opportunities for more advanced players.

Rolling fairways and wind will challenge you, but the course's real test is on its greens. Some are intimidatingly pitched, like on the second and 11th holes where there is more than six feet of elevation change from back to front.

The layout features wide-open fairways that are mostly flat, but there are strategically placed sand bunkers lurking alongside all of them. The golf course is not as seemingly easy as one would think since the open landscape is also subject to strong winds. There are also stands of mature trees throughout as well as waste areas that are waiting to swallow up errant shots. It is not a formidable test by any means but it is not a simple pitch-and-putt either. Players of all skill levels can get some good practice in at Riegelwood Country Club.",,,,,,,

It has a traditional layout that was revamped in 1990 but the original character was carefully preserved. The course is known for the stately oaks that are abundant throughout the course. The mature trees frame the holes and demand accuracy as well as creative shot-making. There are also deep sand bunkers strategically placed along Lake Lawn Resort's greensides.

The course is located on the Novell/Word Perfect campus which explains why there is an executive course in addition to the regular 18 hole course.One word describes the hazards at Timpanogos -- water. Water comes into play on almost every hole and there are several forced carries. This can be one of the most challenging (and frustrating) courses in the area if you're not hitting the ball straight. It's possible to empty your ball bag on this course on a bad day.Favorite holes are number 4 and number 10 (now some other number because the back nine was reordered during 1997). Number 4 is a par 4 which requires a blind tee shot over a marsh. Too short or left and you're dead in the marsh, too far right and you're either wet or are faced with a long second shot. Number 10 (maybe 12 now) is a par five that offers several ways to attack, all of them dangerous. If you go for the green in 2 you have to carry the entire length of a pond. To lay up you have to hit a narrow fairway and risk going too far through and out of bounds.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12822,,,,,,

The course originally opened in 1990 but in 2008 it changed ownership and underwent a major renovation that elevated its conditions to rival that of any of the area's best golf courses. The bunkers were rebuilt and re-sanded and the fairways were re-conditioned. Bear Creek G.C. has always been known for its excellent greens, which have a reputation for being some of the state's finest putting surfaces. The layout measures 6,585 yards from the back tees, which may seem short but there are some ups and downs throughout that will make it feel much longer.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/24773,,,,,,

The front nine is wide open with some room for error but the back nine is routed through woodlands, demanding accuracy and thoughtful strategy. There is an interesting variety of holes as well including short par 4s, moderate par 5s, and tough par 3s that are made even more difficult on a windy days.

Golfers who enjoy playing in the Carolinas will feel right at home on this course. Water or marshland comes into play on 12 holes and there is an abundance of pine trees. The course is also home to a variety of wildlife including osprey, bald eagles, and deer. In addition to the water, strategically placed bunkers add another challenging element to the golf course. The par-5 fourth hole is considered the signature, mostly due to the challenging island green. Proper club selection is key in order to maneuver past the lake that runs along the entire left side of the fairway. The hole is especially hard on windy days.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/692,,,,,,

Thankfully, this monster is void of hazards. On the back No. 13 is feast or famine–a short par 5 at 483 yards, but a pond sits in the middle of the fairway.

The greens are known for being challenging and they are also some of the truest and smoothest putting surfaces you'll find in the area.

Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish.

The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times. Other multiple winners of this longstanding PGA Tour event include Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Nick Price and Ben Crenshaw.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/21496,,,,,,

Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3302,,,,,,

It was the club's original layout before it was joined by the Desert Course a year later. As its name would imply, the Lakes Course features an intricate system of lakes and rivers weaving through the layout and coming into play on 11 holes. The layout is challenging but playable with elevation changes and strategically placed bunkers that are balanced by large greens and wide, player-friendly fairways. One of the golf course's most memorable holes is the par-5 second. This challenging 530-yard hole plays around a massive lake but with an accurate second shot, it is reachable in two. There is also water the left of the green and a bunker in front.",,,,,,,

The secluded location is only accessible by passenger ferry or private boat. It is considered one of finest golf destinations in the Carolinas. The golf course enjoys a coastal landscape of protected salt marshes and a vast expanse of maritime forest. The layout is routed through freshwater lagoons and marshes, which means you'll be facing water on several holes. Rolling dunes provide subtle but challenging contours throughout the course as well. The terrain is tough enough but there are also the ever-present winds to contend with. For some scenic respite from this formidable test, scenic views of the Atlantic can be enjoyed on almost every hole. In addition to the golf course, the club boasts an extensive practice facility that includes a driving range with three target greens, chipping and putting greens, and a short game area.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1226,,,,,,

Many of his designs demand strong iron play and accurate tee shots, and this course is no different. Small, fast greens are the course's signature feature. Undulating breaks make them difficult to read at times. The layout starts with a relatively open front nine where bunkered greens are the most prominent challenges. The back nine is longer and there are more trees and penalty ditches. The 16th hole is one of the most challenging on the golf course with a plateau green that sits four feet above the fairway and flanked with bunkers. The title of most difficult hole though, goes to Benvenue Country Club's fourth hole. There are out-of-bounds along the entire right side of the fairway on this hole and the narrow opening to the green is tightly bordered by three bunkers.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10208,,,,,,

The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times.

The course tumbles across lush green hills and valleys, providing almost every hole with an elevated tee or green. The undulating layout definitely plays like a mountain golf course with even lies being hard to find and a few blind shots to contend with. Water hazards come into play on seven holes, including the first three and the 12th hole, an uphill par 3 that is one of the golf course's most difficult. In addition to the course, Eagle Chase G.C. also offers a driving range, practice bunker, and chipping and putting greens.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1208,,,,,,

True to its name, water is a prominent feature on the golf course. It's not just the water hazards that make this a tough course though. You'll be faced with strategically placed bunkers, sloped greens, and fairways tightly lined with trees. The golf course starts out gentle enough but by the time you get to the third hole, you'll be tested with a hole that plays right into the prevailing wind. This long narrow par 4 is one of the toughest holes Emerald Lake Golf Club has to offer. You'll get a brief break with the fourth hole, but the following par 5 is the signature hole. This risk-reward hole could result in a birdie if you play it smart, but if you go for the green in two and don't make it, you might be punished with a bogey",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10122,,,,,,

The undulating greens follow the natural contours of the landscape and they are accented with pot bunkers to add some challenge. Dye also included his signature multi-level fairways.

This mountain golf course features a variety of elevation changes and nowhere is this more apparent than the small greens where the breaks can vary from subtle to dramatic, but they are almost all unexpected.

The challenging layout demands accuracy and it will also test your shot-making skills. Golfers should expect to utilize every club in their bag. The golf course features tight fairways lined with mature trees, tricky doglegs, and multi-tiered greens that can be difficult to read. The rolling terrain also promises difficult uphill and downhill lies. Bunkers are strategically placed throughout and there is water on a few holes. A windy day adds yet another formidable element to the challenging design. The diverse layout has a mix of difficult par 3s, reachable par 5s, and a few birdie opportunities. Hidden Valley Golf Club will definitely test your skills, but five sets of tees make the course more approachable to a wide range of skill levels.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15453,,,,,,

Fred Mcleaod, then the winter professional at Maryland's Columbia Country Club, built the course in 1909, followed by a redesign at the hands of John Bredemus in 1921 and a rare visit by Robert Trent Jones in the mid-1960s. This beautiful links-style course offers open fairways and undulating greens where stiff winds can interfere with drives and cause high shots to blow wildly off course.When the 9-hole course originally opened on the high-toned North Beach, President William Howard Taft was in Texas to visit his brother, who owned a ranch across Nueces Bay. Taft participated in the opening ceremonies in front of the green wooden building which is distinguished by its white trim and veranda on all four sides.The course fell victim to the 1919 hurricane, and club members didn't reorganize until 1921. John Bredemus came down from Del Rio after the completion of the San Felipe Springs Country Club and immediately put crewmen to work clearing and grading for $1.50 a day. The fairways and greens were fertilized with cottonseed meal, and the first shot was fired on Labor Day, 1922. At the time, this course on the Texas Riviera was considered one of the finest in the country.At the end of the Depression, oil was discovered under the course and wells produced from 1936 to 1943, increasing revenues but creating some interesting man-made hazards in the layout. By 1938, the club expanded the course to 18 holes.

The colorful tales of the Friday game at EPCC paint a vivid picture of how the former cell phone salesman honed his gamesmanship and confidence to the level of a major champion.The present course was designed in 1922 by Jack Harden, then modified via a $1.5 million Ron Fream renovation. The traditional layout is not long (6,889 yards), but requires pro-like accuracy on approach shots, and the bent-grass greens feature the speed and quickness characteristic of any pro setup.No. 15 is the feature hole. It's a short par 4 that requires accuracy to avoid the fairway bunkers and trees off the tee, then a little savvy to deal with the approach shot into a super-slick green covered by more bunkers.Getting there : From I-10 west take Exit 11 and make a left turn onto Mesa.

There are a few water hazards that come into play as well as the occasional bunker, but overall the course is gentle enough for beginners to approach it with confidence. For more advanced players, it is excellent practice, especially for the price. It is not the most challenging golf course you will play in Ohio, but the traditional layout still provides an enjoyable round for all skill levels.",,,,,,,

Let’s list the reasons: Location: Far north Dallas, with White Rock Creek meandering through. Layout: Stunning and traditional, with tree-lined fairways, the right amount of water and bunkering, and huge, lightning-fast bent-grass greens. Feel: Cart paths run the way they should--from greens to tees, not the other way around. And caddies are always available to promote playing the game on foot. Mystique: Memorabilia of professional tour players who are also members is tastefully distributed throughout the clubhouse, and the shrine to Mickey Mantle (a longtime member) is awe-inspiring. You’ll need serious connections to play this course, but here are some highlights.The third hole is a 591-yard par 5 with a narrow tee shot that opens to a wide landing area. The homes lining the right side of the fairway no doubt shelter some of the most jealous people in the world. The second shot begins to run down the dramatic slope that ends in a huge green in front of the creek.The next par 5, the 498 yard 6th, has a similar slope which begins in the landing area of your drive. If you really pop it and have the wind, you’ll be at the base of the hill with about 175 yards left to the large, two-tiered green. Be careful, though–it’s protected by dense woods on the left and back, and water on the front and right.The 7th hole is the number one handicap. This 422-yard par 4 dogleg right requires a perfectly faded and long tee shot to get far enough into the throat to approach. You’ll still be hitting a long iron or wood into the severely back-to-front sloped green, and good luck making the putt from above the hole.The back nine is maybe the best anywhere, but two holes stand out above the rest. The 16th is a 428-yard par 4 with a slight dogleg left. The tee shot is elevated at least 100 yards above where the green sits. A big, high draw will put you about 150 yards away from the two-tiered green, which is protected by the creek in front. They really like to put the pin on the lower tier right in front of the creek, which gives you about 20 square yards to work with. It’s a lay-up hole for all but the longest and bravest.The 422-yard dogleg-right finishing hole is almost a mirror of the 16th–it’s a long dogleg right, all uphill. The tee area is extremely narrow from the tips, and the fairway slopes to the left to make shaving the corner as hard as possible. This ends up being a 5 par for most, and the outcome of many Nassaus is changed on this hole.It’s hard to describe this course without gushing, not to mention that hearing about it just frustrates most people because they won’t have a chance to see it for themselves. But keep your eyes and ears open for friends who may be members and schmooze them as much as possible–it will surely be worth the effort.The details : 972-380-0669. 17201 Preston Trail Dr., Dallas, TX 752481965.

A new generation of golfers like Jimmy Demaret and Claude Harmon, Sr. (Butch's dad) came along, and River Oaks earned a reputation as the hub of Houston golf.Designed by the legendary Donald Ross, River Oaks is a timeless, traditional layout that is one of the most exclusive in the country. The high-dollar real estate that Ross had to work with was small, but covered with stately old oak trees and ancient pines all nestled along the banks of Buffalo Bayou.The layout features some of the area's best short holes-distance isn't an issue, but accuracy is imperative. In addition to the oaks and pines, the skinny fairways are lined with azaleas, magnolias, and dogwoods. The greens are small, slick, and make for challenging targets.Other notes: Joe Finger came along in 1967 to initiate improvements of the greens, tees, and the rerouting of a few holes.Getting there : From I-45 south take the Hwy. 610 exit west and find Westheimer Rd.

Then again, that’s part of the character of the course–you shouldn’t expect to experience a big-city round with low handicappers who are schooled in the proper etiquette of golf.Getting there : From I-20 east, exit 303 turn south (right) on Union Hill Rd.

Loaded with every kind of tree native to this terrain, and highlighted by pesky Rush Creek and other water hazards that come into play on 14 holes, this is a par 70 track that requires you to hit it straight.Early in the round, the 526-yard No. 2 jumps out with a tee shot over water and out-of-bounds lining the fairway. Also on the front, Nos. 4 and 8 involve Rush Creek and are considered among the most difficult on the course.Rest up at the turn and get ready for the challenging opening holes on the back nine. No. 10 goes 437 yards and doglegs to the right with water on each side. No. 11 plays the same distance and is squeezed by a narrow chute of trees. And there’s no forgiveness on No. 12, which requires the navigation of another dogleg right around water.Getting there : From I-30 west, turn onto the East Chase Pkwy., turn left, and when you come to Pioneer Pkwy., make another left.
