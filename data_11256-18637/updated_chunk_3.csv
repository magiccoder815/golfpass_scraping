12105,International Links,"Editor's Note: Course closed for business in 03/2023.The Melreese golf course at International Links is where Tiger Woods made his first professional appearance in south Florida. The championship course, which has six sets of tees, features rolling fairways and large, undulating greens. It is a tight golf course featuring five lakes that come into play on 14 holes. To make up for the damages caused by Hurricane Andrew, the golf course has been outfitted with replanted tall live oak and palm trees that can affect shots. There are also nearly 100 sand bunkers present on the course. The Melreese course's signature hole is the par-4 14th, which is nicknamed ""Heartbreak Ridge."" It has water alongside the right side of the fairway all the way from the tee to the green, and it requires an approach shot past water to an island green. The International Links facility also offers a lighted driving range and putting green.",,,,,,,

Although he reduced the amount of bunkers that were on the golf course, he added three water hazards where the course previously had none. The course features lush tropical landscaping and immaculate conditions. Australian pines and royal palms frame many of the holes.

12478,"Club Renaissance, The","The beautifully manicured, par-72 Renaissance Golf Course features two distinctive nines. The front nine has an open links feel to it with wide fairways and greens that will accept bump-and-run approach shots. The back nine requires more accuracy from tee to green as it meanders through a large conservation area. Water comes into play on every hole on the inward nine on this course designed by Chip Powell. Most fairways are lined with stately pines and ancient oaks. The greens at the Renaissance Golf Club are a pleasure to putt. These TifEagle Bermuda grass putting surfaces are state-of-the-art and roll fast.",https://clubrenaissance.clublink.com/,,,,,,

12497,Hunter's Green Country Club,"Hunter's Green Country Club was carved from native wetlands and pine forests, taking full advantage of the lush Florida landscape. Tom Fazio designed the picturesque golf course. There are carefully placed sand bunkers throughout and water comes into play on a few holes. The golf course finishes with one of its most demanding holes. This par 4 plays over an expansive water hazard with a narrow landing area that demands accuracy. If you manage to hit to the right avoiding the water, there is a long bunker waiting for you. If you hit to the left, there is a densely wooded area next to the cart path to be cautious of. If you decide to leave the driver in the bag and hit a fairway wood or rescue club you will be left with a long approach to an island green.",https://www.invitedclubs.com/clubs/hunter-s-green-country-club,,,,,,
