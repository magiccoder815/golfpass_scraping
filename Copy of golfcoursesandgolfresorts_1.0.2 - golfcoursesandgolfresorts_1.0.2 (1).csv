Tom Fazio designed the course, fully utilizing the existing features of the terrain from the natural slopes and undulations to the many lakes and streams. The layout features rolling fairways and elevated greens framed by carefully sculpted bunkers. Each hole has a different character, as well as a different set of challenges, thanks to the natural elevation changes. The final hole is considered a classic Fazio finishing hole and one of the most memorable on the golf course. This par 5 begins with a downhill tee shot to a wide fairway that slopes towards a large lake on the right, then you'll face an uphill third shot to a green protected by an array of threatening bunkers and a large waterfall.",https://www.ramshill.com/,,,,,
