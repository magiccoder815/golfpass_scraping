Laying up with a long iron is the sensible play here. The middle holes wind through fir and cedar-lined fairways, with a variety of doglegs and ponds to keep you focused. The par five fourteenth at 509 yards from the whites is a challenge not to be taken lightly. Lined by lakes on both sides, with a huge pot bunker guarding the green, you’ll do well to make par here. The 403-yard seventeenth is also a test with its undulating fairways and slippery four-tiered green.After your round, be sure to visit the historic clubhouse, 9,000 square feet and built from hand-hewn logs.
