8152,Royal Montreal Golf Club (Blue Course at Royal Montreal Golf Club),"Opened in 1873, the Royal Montreal Golf Club is the oldest club in North America. It offers two 18-hole golf courses and one nine-hole course. Dick Wilson originally designed the Blue Course in 1958, but in 2004 Rees Jones did a complete renovation. Jones reshaped all of the course's greens, creating several with multiple tiers, and he also rebuilt many of the tees, which are all now square. The fairways and greenside bunkers were completely reconstructed as well to provide a greater challenge. The signature hole is the par-4 16th, which poses a formidable threat since it plays right into prevailing wind. The 14th is also memorable for its treacherous water hazard.",https://rmgc.org/,,,,,,

8177,Le Geant Course at Tremblant,"Le Geant at Mont Tremblant Resort is carved from the mountainsides of the Laurentians. The aptly chosen name translates to 'giant,' referencing the stunning cliffs surrounding the course. The layout is comprised of multiple levels of plateaus that offer panoramic view of the boreal forest and meandering streams that cover the landscape. The golf course is one of two at the resort, the other being Le Diable, or the Devil. While the other course may draw inspiration from it, Le Geant is definitely a more difficult challenge. Although it is shorter, every component of its layout including the numerous sand bunkers, were meticulously placed to provide the greatest challenge.",https://www.tremblant.ca/,,,,,,
8178,Le Chateau Montebello,"Neighbor to the Laurentian Mountains, the Fairmont Le Chateau Montebello Golf Club tumbles across a dramatic, rolling landscape. The course tightly winds through towering forests, which not only provides some challenging holes but also ensures a secluded, closed-in feel. Originally designed by Stanley Thompson in 1929, it has become one of the most popular golf courses in Quebec. In 1998, the scenic course was designated as an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary. The layout is considered one of the toughest in the province. The elevation changes throughout the course offer scenic mountain views but they also guarantee that a flat lie will be hard to find. There are a few water hazards on the golf course but the challenge comes mostly from the well guarded greens. In addition to the course, there is also a driving range and chipping and putting greens.",https://www.fairmont.com/montebello/golf/montebello-golf-course/,,,,,,
