6644,Amery Golf Club,"Located an hour northeast of St. Paul, Amery Golf Club is located in what is known as the ""City of Lakes,"" and so naturally water has a prominent role throughout the course. Built in 1922, the golf course is one of northwestern Wisconsin's premier courses. It has a traditional layout that sprawls across gently rolling hills though it is still a very walkable course. You'll find water coming into play on half of the 18 holes, along with tricky doglegs, forced carries, and a slew of strategically placed bunkers. The diverse landscape of woodlands, wetlands, and hills provide plenty of variety among each hole. Amery Golf Club's 10th is a particularly memorable hole that sits wedged between two bodies of water and it also offers a stunning view.",http://amerygolfclub.com/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi,,,,,,

6656,Baraboo Country Club,"Located just a short drive from Madison, Baraboo Country Club overlooks the rocky bluffs of Devil's Lake State Park. The golf course has a stunning natural setting that is also indicative of the rich history of Baraboo. The course is routed through carefully protected and preserved Indian burial mounds that are more than 1,000 years old. Draper creek ambles through the golf course, connecting Devil's Lake to the Baraboo River. It comes into play on half of the holes. The par-5 eighth is the course's signature. This tricky hole first requires a drive over water to a generous landing area before doglegging left to another landing area that is tightly lined with trees, water, and Indian mounds. Finally there is a blind shot to a sloping green that not only breaks severely from back to front but is also well protected by bunkers.",https://baraboocc.com/,,,,,,
6662,Beaver Dam Country Club,"Beaver Dam Country Club sits just a few miles from Horicon Marsh, the largest freshwater refuge in the U.S. The golf course originally opened as a nine-hole layout in the 1960s but now it is one of the area's most popular 18-hole courses. The layout has a traditional design with small, elevated greens and tree-lined fairways. It is on the shorter side at 6,000 yards, at least by today's standards, but it offers plenty of challenges even without having the length. Strategically placed bunkers lurk beside the greens and the rolling terrain guarantees some tricky lies. The third and eighth are two of Beaver Dam Country Club's particularly memorable holes. These drivable par 4s provide you with the opportunity for an eagle, granted you play skillfully and are blessed with a little luck.",https://www.beaverdamcountryclub.com/,,,,,,
6663,Old Hickory Golf Club,"Beaver Creek divides Old Hickory Golf Club with nine holes sitting north of the creek and nine holes south. The course has a classic parkland layout that plays across gently rolling hills. The fairways were cut through forests of mature hardwoods but they are wide and carefully sculpted to direct balls toward the middle. Skillful players could even try to use the contours to their advantage. Each hole has a bunkers but the bunkering is not excessive. In addition to the mounding and bunkering, the undulating terrain provides natural elevation changes. The golf course finishes with what is arguably its toughest hole. This monster par 5 is 620 yards from the back tees. It requires a drive over a ravine with a natural waste area to the left. Many consider it to be the toughest golf hole in northern Virginia.",https://www.golfoldhickory.com/,,,,,,
6664,Country Club of Beloit,,,,,,,,
6667,Mascoutin Golf Club (Blue/Red Course at Mascoutin Golf Club),"Mascoutin Golf Club offers three nine-hole courses that can be played in different 18-hole combinations. Players of all skill levels will feel comfortable at Mascoutin, no matter which course they choose. The Red and White nines make up the original golf course that opened in 1976 before the Blue nine was added in 1999. The Blue/Red Course combines the shortest nine, Blue, with the longest. The Red nine stretches to just over 2,600 yards, which is over 100 yards longer than the Blue. The Blue nine features a few holes with water and there are a few strategically placed bunkers to contend with. The back nine is arguably the most challenging at Mascoutin G.C. not only for the length but also because of the abundance of mature trees lining the fairways.",https://www.mascoutingolf.com/,,,,,,
6668,Edgewood Golf Course (Oaks Course at Edgewood Golf Course),"Edgewood in Big Bend boasts two different 18-hole courses, the Oaks and the Pines. There is something for everyone no matter what skill level you are since the more challenging Oaks Course is perfectly complemented by the more forgiving Pines Course. The Oaks is routed through a diverse landscape of rolling hills covered with mature forests and lakes. It also winds alongside the Fox River. Water hazards come into play and there are also strategically placed bunkers to contend with. Tremendous emphasis is placed on accuracy on this golf course, but it is not too punishing if your shots are slightly errant. The course stretches to 6,800 yards from the back tees. A cart will be required on this golf course but the flatter, shorter Pines Course is much more walker friendly.",https://edgewoodgolf.com/,,,,,,

6680,Lakewoods Forest Ridges Golf Course,"Lakewoods Resort sits right along the shores of Lake Namakagon, surrounded by the Chequamegon National Forest. The Forest Ridges Golf Course takes full advantage of the beautiful terrain, which is also home to an abundance of wildlife. The heavily forested landscape is dotted with natural wetlands and ponds. Mature trees line the fairways and the greens feature subtle but tricky undulations. Each hole has a unique design that was dictated by the diverse glacial terrain, giving every hole a different character. It is a relatively short course at just over 6,000 yards but there are still challenges in store. Water comes into play on three holes and golfers will be faced with eleven forced carries. It is a playable layout that is a great venue for small group outings or larger tournaments and events.",https://www.lakewoodsresort.com/,,,,,,

6687,Branch River Country Club,"The Golf Course at Branch River, located just west of Manitowoc, is an extension of the former Lakeside Country Club that was established in 1909. Branch River is an 18-hole course that sprawls across rolling, wooded hills. The fairways are lined with mature trees and the gently undulating terrain guarantees a few uneven lies. Strategically placed sand traps and water hazards will further test your accuracy. The vigorous golf course is a good test but it is not so formidable that beginners should be intimidated. The par-4 second hole offers one of the most interesting risk-reward situations on the course. Golfers who are feeling confident with their driver can try to hit it past the big tree hanging over the right side of the fairway, but those who are less confident can play to the 100-yard marker and use a short iron from there.",http://www.golfbranchriver.com/,,,,,,

Its proximity to both Chicago and Milwaukee has made it very popular. The championship golf course was not added until 1921, but it is still one of the area's oldest. It has a traditional layout that was revamped in 1990 but the original character was carefully preserved. The course is known for the stately oaks that are abundant throughout the course.

6749,Abbey Springs Golf Course,"Abbey Springs Golf Course in Fontana is routed through mature woodlands that give it a peacefully secluded feel. Surrounded by countryside and enclosed within towering trees, the course is an ideal getaway. The challenging course has small, sloped greens and water hazards that come into play on half of the holes. It is a golf course that requires accuracy, especially when maneuvering past the strategically placed bunkers that lurk beside the greens. There are plenty of challenges in store for more advanced players, but beginners can still approach the course with confidence. The excellent condition of the course is also a feature that any golfer can appreciate. Abbey Springs Golf Course's signature hole is the par-4 17th, which offers what might be the most scenic of all the vistas on the course. This hole plays from an elevated tee that overlooks Lake Geneva.",https://www.godaddy.com/forsale/abbeysprings.com?utm_source=TDFS_BINNS2&utm_medium=parkedpages&utm_campaign=x_corp_tdfs-binns2_base&traffic_type=TDFS_BINNS2&traffic_id=binns2&,,,,,,

6751,Country Club Estates,"Country Club Estates Golf Course in Fontana is a nine-hole course spread across gently rolling hills. The layout is player friendly enough for beginners and for scratch golfers it's great for a quick round. It can be played in less than two hours. The golf course is wide open, offering beautiful vistas of the Lake Geneva area. It may not be long but it's good practice if you're looking to work on your short game. Proper club selection is the key to scoring well on this course rather than being able to hit long. You'll come across a few blind approaches and the occasional bunker, but it's nothing over difficult. Country Club Estates Golf Course's third hole runs alongside a river and you may catch a glimpse of some wildlife -- including deer and heron -- coming out for a drink of water.",https://ccegolf.com/,,,,,,
6752,Koshkonong Mounds Country Club,"Tucked amongst the rolling hills along the eastern shores of its namesake lake, Koshkonong Mounds Country Club pays homage to the Winnebago tribes that are native to the area. Koshkonong is a word from their language that means ""these waters we live on."" The club was established in 1870 on land that was once known as the country's premier duck hunting destination. The golf course was constructed in 1922 and still stands as Fort Atkinson's only 18-hole layout. The historic Indian effigy mounds were carefully preserved and incorporated into the course as navigational hazards. The golf course is a formidable test in addition to being scenic with plenty of blinds shots in store thanks to the dramatic elevation changes. Golfers should also be prepared for uneven lies. Both distance and accuracy are required for scoring well at Koshkonong Mounds Country Club.",https://www.kmccgolf.com/,,,,,,

There is an interesting mix of holes including challenging par 4s, with the most difficult being the 16th. There are no surprises on this tricky hole because it's tough enough on its own. Golfers should aim to keep it in the fairway and place the second shot below the hole, making sure not to miss the green long or else they're be facing a fast downhill chip shot.",https://www.fireridgegc.com/,,,,,,

6775,Tuscumbia Country Club,"Founded in 1896, Tuscumbia Golf Course is the oldest championship course in Wisconsin.

The layout is routed through a maze of mature trees, they line the tight fairways and frame the demanding greens. There is also thick rough to contend with as well as strategically placed bunkers. The classic layout is more challenging than what you would expect from a traditional golf course from that era. It demands accuracy as well as skillful course management but it is a fair test that is still player-friendly enough for beginners to approach with confidence. Your skills will be tested but the holes are fairly straightforward with no hidden hazards and there is hardly any water in play.",https://tuscumbia.net/,,,,,,

The layout is traditional in design and player friendly enough for beginners, but it still offers a few challenges. It's a short golf course by modern standards, measuring 6,519 yards from the back tees. Water isn't terribly prominent, but golfers should be prepared for back-to-back water hazards starting with the third hole.

The distinctive layout will test your creative shot-making skills.
