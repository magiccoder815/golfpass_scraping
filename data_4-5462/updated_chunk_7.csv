3513,Hillcrest Golf Club,"Alvin's second country club opened in the 1960s, built by a man named Shorty Plaster who wanted to make the most of his land investment. Shorty was a hacker and his short course is designed to accommodate the lesser golfer with its executive-like 2,385-yard length.Plaster's design opens up with three par 3s, followed by another on No. 5. Every par 4 plays 350 yards or less, and the sole par 5 is only 475 yards. Not many non-par-3 9-holers are blessed with lights, but this one is. The same goes for the driving range, so you can definitely spend some hours at this nice little country course.Getting there : From I-45 south, exit Dixie Farm Rd. and turn right. Drive 8 miles to where it dead-ends, then turn on Hwy 35. Drive 8 miles to Fairway Dr. and turn left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2726,,,,,,

3911,Apollo Elks Country Club,"Apollo Elks Country Club, situated just northeast of Pittsburgh, is considered one of the area's must-play golf courses. It has appeal for a wide range of skill levels with a layout that is challenging enough for seasoned golfers but also not too difficult for beginners to approach. There is an interesting mix of holes ranging from reachable par 5s to short, tough par 3s and each hole has a distinct character. The greens are fast and the gently rolling terrain provides some subtle breaks that can be tricky. Bunkering is sparsely but strategically placed along the fairways and greensides. There are also a few water hazards that come into play at Apollo Elks Country Club. The round has plenty to hold your attention but don't forget to stop and admire the beautiful western Pennsylvania scenery.",https://www.apolloelkscountryclub.com/,,,,,,

3920,Inniscrone Golf Club,"Inniscrone Golf Club in Avondale is one of the toughest public courses in the area. It is a formidable challenge to say the least, but an enjoyable one. None of the holes run parallel to each other and no two holes are alike either. The greens have quite a bit of variation from one to the next but mostly they are very large and extremely fast. Although the greens only have mild contouring, the rippling landscape still provides plenty of challenges throughout. Strategically placed bunkers perfectly complement the dramatic elevation changes, ranging from pot bunkers to vast expanses of sand. Inniscrone Golf Club's ninth hole is a memorable one since it encapsulates the course's appeal with a ridge of cross-bunkers just off the tee and even more along the left side.",https://www.inniscronegolfclub.com/,,,,,,

3954,Meadowlands Country Club,"Meadowlands Golf & Country Club has a classic course design that appeals to a range of skill levels, from beginners to seasoned players. The rolling landscape provides the layout with undulating greens and fairways. The Hope River borders the golf course's eastern side, coming into play on a few holes. A small pond also comes into play on two holes. The challenging fairways are tight and lined with mature trees including towering firs, cottonwoods, and maple trees. The small, heavily bunkered greens make the course even trickier. Meadowlands Golf & Country Club's signature hole is the par-4 14th. This hole begins with a difficult tee shot past a gully to a sharp dogleg left fairway and then moves on to a second shot to a green that is blocked by a massive oak tree to the front right.",https://ww12.meadowlandsgolfcountry.com/?usid=19&utid=19937653817,,,,,,

3970,Conley Resort,"Conley Resort & Golf plays across the rolling hills of western Pennsylvania, just north of Pittsburgh. The course is an enjoyable round no matter what skill level. It is not an overly difficult or long course, but it was never meant to be a formidably tough round. The design was meant to appeal to not only high handicappers but also golfers who are looking for a casual but interesting round. For this reason, the resort is an ideal place for a relaxed outing. The golf course is playable but that doesn't mean golfers won't come across a fair amount of challenges. The 13th and 18th are two particularly tricky holes. The former is a par 4 with six sand traps lining a narrow fairway, and the finishing hole is a par 3 with water lining another narrow fairway and a large pond behind the raised green.",https://www.conleyresort.com/,,,,,,
