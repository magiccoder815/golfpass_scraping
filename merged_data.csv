39,Avila Beach Resort,"Avila Beach Golf Resort is located right along the bay, giving it a scenic setting that has made it the most well known of the Central Coast golf courses. The layout offers plenty of variety with a hilly front nine that features small, often elevated, greens that are surrounded by oak-lined valleys and a back nine that that is routed across a tidal estuary. Golfers should be prepared for forced carries over water and multi-tiered greens on the backside. At first the course may seem short, but thanks to the dramatic elevation changes and numerous other challenges, it will begin to feel much longer. There are several severe doglegs throughout as well as tight approaches. Avila Beach Golf Resort is not a layout where you can easily ""grip it and rip it.""

The country club sits just 10 minutes outside of downtown Cincinnati.A Scottish golfer and designer, Bendelow created several Midwest courses. Bendelow designed 800-plus North American courses, working with land he was assigned: In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, architects didn't get their turf, rocks and water features trucked in. Born Sept. 2, 1868, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bendelow began golfing when he was 9 years old, with his dad at the Balgownie Links, which now goes by Royal Aberdeen Golf Club - founded in 1780, Royal Aberdeen Golf Club is the world's sixth-oldest, and it's clear that Bendelow had rich inspiration to draw on back in Scotland.After a round of golf at the Western Hills Country Club, head back to the Grill Porch for nibbles and sips.",https://www.westernhillscc.com/,,,,,,

256,Oak Hills Country Club,"""Oak Hills is classic golf architecture at its finest,"" says Carl Bielstein, La Cantera's director of golf, about Oak Hills Country Club's heritage and its noted architect, A.W. Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.oakhillscc.com/,,,,,,

445,Soldiers Creek Golf Club At The Preserve,"The course at Soldiers Creek Golf Club was designed by Scott Clark, a former Golf Course Superintendent at The Grand Hotel in Point Clear Alabama and the current Superintendent at The Peninsula Golf Club in Gulf Shores Alabama. While this is Scott's first attempt in playing the role of a course architect, it also reveals his depth of experience in the golf course industry. The design goals of building a course that would be enjoyable for high handicappers as well as low handicappers was met in this design.The course features wide player-friendly fairways. Also, water comes into play on only two holes which makes navigating this course easier for high handicappers. A large natural turf driving range and 10,000 square foot practice green is available as a warm-up or practice area.Soldiers Creek Golf Club is owned by the Norman Woerner family. Norman is a member of the Woerner Turf family of sod producers. Woerner Turf is a world-wide leader in turf production. The company provides turf for many golf courses ranging from Augusta National to new courses in Hong Kong. They also supply the turf for the NFL Super Bowl and the NFL Pro Bowl in Hawaii.Southern Turf Nurseries provided the Tif Eagle for Soldiers Creek Golf Club. This turf grass is considered by many to be the best-of-the-best turf for southern golf course greens. The fairways and roughs are Tif 419, a dense-growing emerald-colored grass that's perfect for plush fairways.The greens feature Tif Eagle, the newest and best-of-the-best southern turf grass for golf course greens. An increasingly popular choice for new golf courses and redesigns, this turf permits a closer cut, thus allowing for smoother, faster greens.Located only several miles from Alabama's sun-kissed Gulf Coast, this new 18 hole championship course is part of the Woerner Preserve Resort. Our friendly staff welcomes you to play the newest course on the Gulf Coast. Yes, we are now open. Come spend some time with family or friends. Relax and enjoy a round of golf in this natural setting.DIRECTIONS: From I-10, take exit 44 (Gulf Shores Pkwy/Hwy 59 South). Travel south on Hwy 59 for approx. 18 miles. Turn left onto Hwy 98 (at light in Foley). Travel approx. 10 miles to Co. Rd 95. Turn right and go 1 ½ mile. Course is on the left.",https://www.soldierscreekgolfcourse.com/,,,,,,

The parkland layout has a beautifully rolling terrain that provides dramatic elevation changes throughout. The course has a balance of excellent shot values and interesting challenges that will appeal to players of all skill levels. The greens can be especially tricky since they are fast, undulating, and often putt downhill. There are numerous bunkers lurking around the greens and water hazards come into play on nearly every hole, 16 to be exact. Proper club selection and accurate shot placement will be generously rewarded but the golf course is not overly punishing if you're a little off your game. The signature hole is the par-5 third, which requires an approach shot to an island green.",https://www.metamoragolf.com/,,,,,,
840,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

Water hazards come into play on a few holes and towering trees line the fairways. The greens are fast and the rough can be punishing.

The course was also lengthened by 300 yards. In addition to the strategically placed bunkers and mature trees, water also comes into play on a few holes in the form of ponds and streams and the gently rolling terrain provides a few tricky lies.

The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is.

The layout has an interesting mix of holes with some that have a Scottish-links style while others are so lined with trees that it feels like you're in the North woods. Overall, it's a player-friendly golf course but there are some challenging par 5s and you'll definitely get a chance to work on your iron game. Heritage Glen's sixth hole might turn out to be one of the hardest par 5s you'll ever play. It stretches to 625 yards from the back tees with a marsh to the left and a bunker surrounding the green.

This infamous hole features a tee that sits high above a treacherous green that is surrounded on three sides by water and even further protected with three sand traps. The hole is also completely isolated thanks to the surrounding mature trees. There is another par 3 on the golf course that is almost as equally tough, the 15th.

His design includes more traditional elements such as wide fairways and large greens, but there are many challenges in store on this formidable golf course. The front nine, dubbed the ""forest nine,"" demands accuracy due to the presence of towering mature trees but the open back nine is characterized by pristine white sand dunes. Water hazards and bunkers come into play frequently throughout the entire Forest Dunes golf course.

Golfers should be prepared for a variety of elevation changes and tricky uneven lies. Natural marsh areas come into play and there is a combination of conventional and pot bunkers, some with sod walls that make recovery difficult. Trees and mounding border the fairways and the challenging greens features a mix of ridges, tiers, and undulations. The no. 1 handicap hole is the second, which is both dramatically scenic and hard, This tough par 4 can be reached in regulation with a risky shot over the wetlands or it can be played safe to the right on the second shot.",https://doublejj.com/thoroughbred-golf-club/,,,,,,

It's easy to get distracted on this visually stunning golf course, but it's a test that requires all of your attention. The first hole is challenging but gentler than the next three holes, which is one of the toughest sequences in the area.

The holes on the backside are more heavily treed and demand greater accuracy. Strategically placed bunkers frame the greens, making the approaches even more intimidating, and the river also comes into play. Straight shots will be rewarded at Pine River G.C. but it's not an overly punishing layout for the high handicapper.

Both golf courses are spread across rolling hills covered with mature pine forests, encapsulating the best that northern Michigan golf has to offer. Although they share the same scenic landscape, the courses have a unique character as well as a different set of challenges. Betsie Valley's tight layout and small greens make it a true shot-maker's course. Many of the greens are also severely sloped, making them even more challenging.

Each hole has a unique design that combines strategically placed bunkers, including large waste bunkers, and sloping grass swales. There is also carefully sculpted mounding along the edges of the fairways. On top of that, water comes into play on nearly every hole. English Turn's signature hole, the 15th, is a tricky par 5 with an island green but it's the final hole, a par 4 with water all along the left side, that is rumored to be the golf course's toughest.",https://www.englishturngolf.com/,,,,,,

1229,"Bluffs on Thompson Creek, The","The Bluffs on Thompson Creek enjoys a beautiful setting tucked away amid mature hardwood forests. Creeks freely meander throughout the golf course, interconnecting with the sparkling ponds that can be found throughout. The layout is an Arnold Palmer design that takes advantage of the hills, bluffs, and hollows of the varied landscape. You face uneven lies and a few blind shots thanks to the terrain but you'll also get scenic views of the surrounding area. Accuracy is important to have but it's not an overly punishing layout if you happen to be errant. The golf course has a challenging start with an uphill par 3 as the opening hole. Another memorable hole is the par-3 eighth, which features a 50-foot drop to the fairway below. It's both an intimidating and beautiful hole.",https://thebluffs.com/,,,,,,

The course is a challenging test without being too intimidating for beginners. It offers risk-reward holes that will appeal to low and high handicappers alike. Lee Schmidt, who worked closely with Pete Dye, designed the golf course, and incorporated many of Dye's signature features into the design. Sculpted mounding and native grasses frame the generous landing areas and you'll even find Dye's trademark railroad ties framing the greens. There are also several lakes that come into play throughout. Oak Harbor Golf Club's seventh and 15th holes are particularly notable for their intimidating tee shots over water. If you strategize carefully, the four par 5s provide some birdie opportunities but you'll have to carefully navigate through a combination of water, traps, and undulations.",https://www.oakharborgolf.com/,,,,,,

The club first opened in 1969 with a nine-hole golf course, which was later expanded to 18 holes in 1972. A renovation of the golf course resulted in a redesign of five holes on the front nine and a new irrigation system. Southbrook Golf & Country Club now plays to a 6,560 yards and its new challenges demand precision and keen course strategy. The meandering Welland river snakes through the golf course as well, coming into play on 13 holes while also enhancing the natural beauty of the course.",https://southbrookgolf.ca/,,,,,,
1279,Austin Country Club,"Back around 1900, when the greater Austin area was only home to about 25,000 residents, Harvard Law School graduate and lifetime Austinite Lewis Hancock organized one of Texas’ first formal country clubs, the venerable Austin Country Club.The first nine-hole course, now known as Hancock Park, featured sand greens and a tiny two-room framed clubhouse. The club stayed put for half a century, noted for the presence of Harvey Penick. Then after a huge local debate, the facility was moved to Riverside Drive in East Austin. From there it made it another 35 years before moving to its current Davenport Ranch location.The current ACC layout, designed by Pete Dye, rests on the shores of Lake Austin and the Colorado River. Dye didn’t veer from his usual method of creating an impressively difficult track using his trademark railroad ties, deep pot bunkers, and huge undulations.The opening holes play along Lake Austin, and are more of a links-style design. Afterwards the Hill Country takes effect, featuring canyons, ravines, creeks, and unbelievable views.The back nine features many outstanding holes, including the 446-yard No. 11, which deceptively doglegs left along a canyon before requiring an approach over that same deep ravine. The par 3 No. 16 also stands out, featuring a long carry over another canyon.",https://www.austincountryclub.com/,,,,,,

Suffice it to say that those strings would never be pulled in today’s environmentally conscious age.Getting there : From Highway 620 west, drive about 6 miles past the dam and turn right on Lakeway Drive.

The course was designed to blend seamlessly into the natural setting while still testing your shot-making skills. You won’t find any man-made water hazards or artificial mounding on this golf course, instead you’ll be challenged by natural streams and ponds and mature evergreens. At first glance, the layout is seemingly wide open, but don’t let your guard down because the fairways are actually quite tight and many of them are strategically lined with trees. In keeping with the time it was built, the greens are smaller than those you would find on most modern golf courses and heavily protected by sand traps. Over the years, Mattawang Golf Club has built a reputation for having some of the well maintained putting surfaces in the area.",https://www.mattawang-golf.com/,,,,,,

2462,Oak Valley Golf Club,"This course used to be considered a hidden gem. Now, Oak Valley Golf Course in Beaumont is an off-the-beaten-path known reasonable joy. Stopping on the way from Los Angeles to Palm Springs for a golf detour is no fool's play. Not with the fast greens, dramatic elevation changes and swerving fairways available at Oak Valley in Beaumont.A Lee Schmidt and Brian Curley design, Oak Valley is probably best known for greens that are anything but desert typical. Speed is the name of the game here, with a tap sometimes too much on a downhill putt.Recognition does not travel that quickly. It took a decade for Oak Valley to get a four star rating from Golf Digest. Once it did, Beaumont suddenly became a golf stopping spot on the Palm Springs express. Now, you're considered a smart golfer if you linger on the way to Palm Springs.""It's a nice getaway from the crowds in the desert, as well as some of the other, more populated golf areas,"" head pro Scott Arnold said. ""It's almost like being in the country. No houses line the fairways. Each hole is different. And because of the way it's laid out, you often can't even see another hole from the one you're playing.""",http://www.oakvalleygolf.com/,,,,,,

Elaborate hills and greenside swales protect many of the putting complexes. The putting surfaces on the front nine are relatively calm when compared to the back nine where most of the greens are double-tiered, ridged, or layered.

In addition to the course, Olde Fort has a driving range as well as chipping and putting greens for golfers to use.

2660,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

Like many golf courses in the area, Yadkin is routed up and down rolling terrain and through mature trees. The layout is challenging with an interesting mix of holes, none of which run parallel to each other. The par 3s are long and there are a few reachable par 5s. The par 4s will make you think, requiring thoughtful drives and approaches. Strategically placed bunkers and mounding lurk throughout and water hazards come into play on a few holes.

The layout has a wide open front nine before it moves onto hillier, more wooded terrain. The first nine holes are more forgiving than the back nine, allowing some room for error off the tees. The back nine is a scenic round of holes, sprawling across gently rolling hills studded with mature trees. There are also some challenging par 3s that require a carry over water. Sedgewood Country Club is a diverse golf course that is approachable for all skill levels and made even more accommodating thanks to three different sets of tees.",,,,,,,

There are also some par 4s in the 450-yard range. The 6,521-yard length indicated on the scorecard can be deceiving since it feels much longer when you're playing it. The golf course has plenty of variety, including dogleg lefts, doglegs rights, short holes, and long holes. Thanks to its mountaintop locale, Cold Spring C.C. offers stunning views that are as diverse as the holes. The vistas from the elevated tees and greens stretch to the Berkshires, Connecticut, and Vermont. From the golf course's highest tee box on the par-3 10th, you'll have a panoramic view of central Massachusetts.",https://www.coldspringcc.com/,,,,,,

There is also a surprising amount of elevation changes throughout that make the course even more challenging. The occasional water hazard comes into play but they do not pose a serious threat. Good course management is key but overall it is a playable round no matter what your skill level though it doesn't hurt to warm up on the club's driving range or putting green. Pine Hills G.C. location nestled within the forest may explain why it is still one of the best-kept secrets in central Wisconsin.",https://www.pinehillsgolf.net/,,,,,,

The golf course blends seamlessly with the scenic surroundings. Strategically placed bunkers fiercely protect the greens and golfers should also be prepared for some tricky forced carries. The fairways are generous and forgiving though. The course is a fair test but it is especially tough on windy days. The interior, tree-lined holes contrast nicely with the waterfront holes and they have the added benefit of protection from the prevailing sea breezes. North Shore Country Club is a player-friendly layout that both beginners and seasoned players can enjoy, which is why it has become one of the Outer Banks' most popular golfing destinations.",https://www.northshoregolfcoursenc.com/,,,,,,

The championship layout features a variety of challenges including tree-lined fairways, water hazards, and strategically placed sand traps. There are also a few sharp doglegs to watch out for. It's the many elevation changes though, which can range from subtle to dramatic, that are the true test of this golf course. Be prepared for several tricky uphill, downhill, and sidehill lies. From the tips, Holland Hills Country Club is quite formidable but multiple sets of tees make it more player friendly for all skill levels.",http://hollandhillscountryclub.com/,,,,,,

It's one of western New York's most accessible public golf courses. The course opened in 1930 as the first public nine-hole layout in LeRoy. The creation of the golf course was spearheaded by Orator Woodward, youngest song of Jell-O magnate Donald Woodward. He believed the landscape of rolling hills and meandering streams was the ideal setting for a round of golf. The natural contours of the terrain helped to determine the placement of the bunkers. Water comes into play on a few holes at LeRoy Country Club, most notably on the finishing two. A large lake on the 17th turns into a creek that wanders across the middle of the final par-3 hole.",http://www.leroycc.com/,,,,,,

Skillful players could even try to use the contours to their advantage. Each hole has a bunkers but the bunkering is not excessive. In addition to the mounding and bunkering, the undulating terrain provides natural elevation changes. The golf course finishes with what is arguably its toughest hole. This monster par 5 is 620 yards from the back tees. It requires a drive over a ravine with a natural waste area to the left.

One of the trickiest holes is the par-3 third, which requires a carry over a massive lake to a small green. Although there are also mature trees lining the fairways, the holes are fairly straightforward. Beginners can approach this golf course with confidence but more advanced players will find it to be a fun casual round. The Gold Course is a better option for a tougher challenge.

Formerly a stable, the course features large meadows and dense groves of trees that frame the fairways and greens. The layout has a more traditional, links design that features occasional water hazards, most notably on the par-5 ninth and 18th holes that share a large lake, but the tree-covered hills are the true challenge of the golf course. Although there are many difficult elements on this course, five sets of tees make it accessible for players of all skill levels. Royal Ontario Golf Club is often compared to the Masters Course at Lionhead Golf & Country Club.",https://kaneffgolf.com/golf/courses/royal-ontario/,,,,,,
3212,Broadacres Golf Club,"Broadacres Golf Club is situated in southern Rockland County on the border between New York and New Jersey. Its convenient location allows for easy access from both states and it's only a 20-minute ride from midtown Manhattan. The golf course has nine holes with an alternate set of tees for an 18-hole round. The layout sprawls across rolling hills dappled with towering oak trees. The golf course incorporates a variety of elevation changes that range from subtle to dramatic. With narrow, tree-lined fairways and undulating greens, accuracy will serve you well on this course. You'll face several doglegs and there are strategically placed bunkers fiercely guarding the greens. Broadacres Golf Club's signature third hole is one of the toughest holes in the area. This par 3 plays up a steep hill to an undulating green.",https://www.broadacresgolf.com/,,,,,,

Several strategically placed bunkers lurk along the greens and a few water hazards also come into play, most notably on the par-5 third hole where a lake sits in the center of the fairway. Red Hook Golf Club finishes with a tough par 4 that requires a tee shot over a deep hollow to a sloped fairway with trees and a pond lining the left side. After that, you'll be faced with an elevated green protected in front by steep bunkers.",https://redhookgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

3419,Great Rock Golf Club,"Opened in 2001, Great Rock Golf Club is one of the newer golf clubs in Long Island but it feels much older thanks to its scenic landscape of rolling green hills covered with mature forests. The mountainous landscape provides plenty of elevation changes that make it difficult to find a flat lie. At 6,254 yards, the course is short but it is still a challenging round with narrow, tree-lined fairways that demand accuracy. There is hardly any water on the golf course but with strategically placed bunkers, sidehill lies, and towering trees to contend with, golfers will hardly notice the absence of water hazards. Great Rock's signature hole is the challenging 10th. This par-4 beast is a double uphill climb with a seemingly flat green, but if you read it that way, you're in for some trouble.",http://www.greatrockgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

3513,Hillcrest Golf Club,"Alvin's second country club opened in the 1960s, built by a man named Shorty Plaster who wanted to make the most of his land investment. Shorty was a hacker and his short course is designed to accommodate the lesser golfer with its executive-like 2,385-yard length.Plaster's design opens up with three par 3s, followed by another on No. 5. Every par 4 plays 350 yards or less, and the sole par 5 is only 475 yards. Not many non-par-3 9-holers are blessed with lights, but this one is. The same goes for the driving range, so you can definitely spend some hours at this nice little country course.Getting there : From I-45 south, exit Dixie Farm Rd. and turn right. Drive 8 miles to where it dead-ends, then turn on Hwy 35. Drive 8 miles to Fairway Dr. and turn left.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/2726,,,,,,

The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is.

The winding layout has many doglegs and incorporates a variety of elevation changes. Golfers should be prepared for a fair amount of blind shots as well as uneven lies. The spacious golf course has several holes that will please long hitters, but this layout will test your accuracy and course-management skills too. Water comes into play most memorably on Greencastle's signature third hole where there is a man-made waterfall and fountain but the par-4 10th is the toughest. This hole has an island green that is cut in half by a large drop in elevation, a good test for the two following holes which are not any less challenging.",https://greencastlegolf.com/,,,,,,

4167,Colonial Country Club,"Colonial Country Club, located in Fort Worth on the southern banks of the Trinity River and near TCU, is one of the most historic golf clubs in Texas. The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times. Other multiple winners of this longstanding PGA Tour event include Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Nick Price and Ben Crenshaw.",https://www.colonialgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings.

Nicklaus utilized the natural features of the site including the lakes and streams, rolling terrain, and abundant wetlands.

All of the holes were carefully carved from the surrounding woodlands and molded into the hillsides. An abundance of trees characterizes the course, giving all of the holes a secluded feel that is further enhanced by the design, which doesn't feature any parallel fairways. The Trail/Blue Course combines the shortest and longest nines but both are considered slightly more challenging than the Ridge nine. The Trail nine possesses two of the four water holes at the club.

The heathlands layout feels like a links course with wind being an important factor and thick fescue coming into play. The golf course starts with an especially tough front nine but there are more scoring opportunities on the back. Mounded bunkers and moguls define the movement of the fairways and though there aren't many trees, if you don't keep your shots straight you might find yourself out-of-bounds or lost in the high, wiry grass. Sidehill lies await you as well as a few blind shots. Wyncote's greens have little undulation but the lightning fast putting surfaces are a challenge for players of all skill levels.

The East Course, the original layout, has hosted a number of legendary players, including Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead, since 1912. Ross carefully sculpted the mountainous landscape to create a course that is both challenging and memorable. It is shorter and tighter than the other course but they are equal in level of difficulty.

The golf course is known for its playability but there are several challenges in store that will test your shot-making skills. The course starts out mildly with a front nine that sprawls across gently undulating meadows while the back nine gets hillier and more challenging. There are more lakes and strategically placed bunkers that come into play on the back as well as a hidden brook that is just waiting for errant shots. Regent's Glen's 11th hole is one of the most intimidating, with a large lake along the fairway. If you dare to carry a portion of this hazard, you'll be rewarded with a shorter approach to the flagstick, however the hidden brook and deep bunker in front of the green will make that very difficult. You'll have to choose your strategy carefully and proper club selection is also key.",https://www.regentsglen.com/,,,,,,

4574,Portage Country Club,"Portage Country Club is situated along the scenic shores of Swan Lake. Opened in 1930, the golf course has a traditional layout that is both challenging and playable. At 6,356 yards from the back tees, it is shorter than most championship courses you will find today but the layout still has plenty to offer besides length. There is a mix of holes that are wide-open and some that are framed by stands of mature trees. The rolling terrain provides subtle but tricky undulations in the greens and fairways as well as the occasional double-tiered green. One of the most memorable holes for both its level of difficulty and the scenery is the par-4 third. This no. 1 handicap hole plays along the lake and forces you to keep a close eye on the target.",https://portagecc.net/,,,,,,

His unwavering dedication to preserving the natural landscapes he works with is also apparent in the unspoiled beauty of the terrain. Hundreds of mature trees cover the golf course, which extends beyond 7,000 yards from the tips.

The greens putt true and fast but they are known for their massive size. There are some that measure in at over 10,000 square feet. Proper placement is the key to this demanding layout.

The heavily wooded back nine presents an entirely different challenge. Drawing more from the style of classic American courses, the back nine has a dramatic rolling landscape blanketed with trees, which often come into play along the fairways. From the blustery fairways on the front nine to the narrows fairways of the back as well as the large, fast greens throughout, Jefferson Golf & Country Club demands accuracy from start to finish.

5177,Inverness Club,"Inverness Club in Toledo is one of the Midwest’s most prestigious tournament venues. The club was founded in 1903 and hired Donald Ross in 1916 to design a championship-caliber, 18-hole course. He delivered, and the 1920 U.S. Open was soon held here. It has hosted four U.S. Opens, two PGA Championships and a U.S. Amateur. It is also the host of the 2020 LPGA Drive On Championship and 2021 Solheim Cup. The course has been renovated, expanded and redesigned over the 100-plus years of existence. Architect Andrew Green extensively restored the Donald Ross layout in 2018, while also adding some new features as a result of property expansion. The cathedral clock, still on display in the clubhouse, was presented by the participants of the 1920 U.S. Open, and Inverness was the first club to permit the players into the member’s clubhouse. Inverness’ crest is inscribed with the Latin words “Concordia et Fidelitas,” which translates to “Harmony and Faithfulness.”",https://invernessclub.com/,,,,,,

5632,Riverchase Golf Club,"One of Jim Fazio’s first solo projects, Riverchase is a surprisingly tough challenge given its lack of trees and relatively short length. The course runs through the bottomlands of the Elm Fork Trinity River and is loaded with water due to a chain of interconnecting lakes created to collect heavy rains and irrigate the course. While there are no forced carries, water comes into play at least 12 holes, and out-of-bounds is a frequent concern because of the housing community that surrounds the course.No. 5 is the most difficult rated hole–a long dogleg right par 4 that requires a solid tee shot to be in position to reach the green in two. The approach is long and uphill into a severely back-to-front sloping green with a lake on the right and out-of-bounds and bunkers on the left.Two holes later, No. 7 is one of the toughest approaches in all of DFW. This hole plays due south into the prevailing wind, and the elevated green has a depth of only about 25 feet. Bunkers line the back, and the slope in front is significant. Ups and downs are difficult because of the slopes in the green. Take a look at the pin placement when you’re teeing off on No. 4.The good news is that other than out-of-bounds, the course is mostly wide open, so you’ll generally have a shot if you just miss the fairway. The only thick spot for trees is along the creek on holes 14-16.Getting there : Take the Belt Line exit off of 635 and drive north to MacArthur. Turn right (east) and drive to Riverchase Dr., where you’ll turn left. Look for the course on the right side of the road.",https://www.riverchasegc.com/,,,,,,

5657,Wolf Creek Golf Links,"Named after Wolf Creek, which runs through the course and was once the site of an old Indian campground, this is a links-style course set in the rolling terrain north of town. Wide-open fairways lure you to use your driver off the tee, and drives that find the firm fairways will roll more than usual, setting up a short iron for the approach. Water hazards are on five of the nine holes. Pay once and play all day.Getting there : From I-20, exit Country Club Rd. and drive north to the course.",,,,,,,

5662,Thorntree Country Club,"Thorntree opened in 1984, and while it has changed ownership multiple times over the years,it remains one of the toughest courses in the DFW area. The course features six lakes and three spring-fed creeks that spice up the layout, as well as immaculate fairways and challenging bent-grass greens.On the front, No. 5 stands out as one of the most difficult holes – a 400 yard-plus par 4 that runs through a chute of trees and doglegs right into a green sided by a pond.The back is a bit more difficult, which you’ll realize quickly due to the 666-yard double dogleg No. 10. The next hole is only a 382- yard par 4, but the approach is dicey into the shallow green. No. 13 is another nice hole–only 338 yards with another challenging approach into a green that’s guarded by an old thorn tree.Getting there : From I-35 south, take the Wintergreen Road exit and turn right.

Designed by architect Gary Stephenson, the course opened the second nine in October 2002.The signature hole is on the front, a 566-yard par 5 that requires a monster drive followed by two demanding approach shots.Getting there : From Dallas take I-35 to Denton and look for the 35 W split. This takes you back towards the south to Fort Worth for 6 miles, where you’ll take the Robson Ranch exit. Drive 1.5 miles west and look for the course.",https://www.robsonranchgolfclub.com/,,,,,,
5666,Yoakum County Golf Club,"Located between Denver City and Plains, Yoakum County is a wide-open course that was built on moderately rolling terrain. Water hazards (ponds, lakes, creeks, and streams) come into play on over half the holes, which is surprising for a course in this region. Avoid the driver if you can, as the course is short enough to score well without it. (You might need the driver, though, on the number-one handicap, a 440-yard, par 4 No. 14.)Watch for storms blowing in quickly on hot, summer afternoons. The course gained a few moments of fame one recent June when newscasts captured winds upwards of 100 MPH that took out whole trees and blew roofs off buildings.Getting there : From Lubbock drive through Brownfield; 12 miles south is Wellman. Take a right on Hwy. 213. The course is 23 miles west of Wellman on the south side of the road. Turn left at the stop sign and button-hook back through the park.",https://www.yoakumcountygolf.com/,,,,,,
5667,Underwood Golf Complex(Sunrise Course at Underwood Golf Complex ),"Sunrise opened in April of 1995, bringing a more modern layout to the Underwood facility. Ken Dye (Painted Dunes) built the course as sort of a Scottish links/desert-style track with undulating fairways and a multitude of water hazards. Quite a bit of dirt was moved to sculpt the flat terrain.On the front No. 5 stands out because it plays as a 465-yard par 4, but No. 9 is the most difficult because of its even greater length-a 587-yard par 5. Holes of note on the back are the 302-yard No. 11, which offers a great chance for birdie; another long par 4 in No. 13 (452 yards); and the mean 18th, a 441-yard dogleg right.Getting there : Located off I-10 and Gateway. From I-10 east, take US Hwy. 54 north and exit Ellerthorpe. Turn right and drive down the road into the housing development, where you will eventually see the clubhouse.",https://bliss.armymwr.com/programs/underwood-golf-complex,,,,,,
5668,Vista Hills Country Club,"Vista Hills is a private track built by Bruce Devlin and Robert von Hagge in 1974. This is a fairly long, desert-style course that winds through a residential subdivision with out-of-bounds lining narrow fairways on many holes. Some holes have slight elevation changes and can leave you with uneven lies.Hole 4 offers a nice touch: a 384-yard par 4 with an outstanding view of El Paso and Mexico. The long No. 17 has out-of-bounds on either side of the fairway, and a water hazard 100 yards out from the green. At 450 yards even a big drive leaves you with a long approach. The 13th hole is only 307 yards and doglegs right, which tempts you to cut the corner over the apartments.Getting there : Take the Lee Trevino exit off of I-10. Turn left, and make another left when you come to Trawood St. The clubhouse is on the left side of the street.",http://www.vistahillscc.com/,,,,,,

The golf course has a traditional desert landscape but the stunning mountain views elevate it to a truly unique experience. The course has a classic design that is player friendly enough for beginners and even gentle enough juniors. It may not be what you're looking for if you want a formidable test, but more advanced players will appreciate it for a quick casual round. It's also great for working on your short game skills. The golf course is short and tight with immaculately manicured greens. You won't find much water at Woodhaven Country Club except on the 17th, which seems like its nearly all water.",https://www.woodhavencc.com/,,,,,,
5677,Stonebriar Country Club,"Located at what for now is the end of the north-bound Dallas Tollway is the Stonebriar's Fazio Course, 30 minutes from downtown Dallas and an ideal business or resort getaway because of its convenient location near the generally fast moving north-south thoroughfare. And in addition to the hotel-business conference amenities, there’s the spectacular Tom Fazio route awaiting that is open for play only to resort guests and members of the adjoining Stonebriar Country Club.This place embodies Dallas’ northward surge. In the 1960s and 1970s, the new construction was further south in Richardson and Plano, when places like Preston Trails defined the suburbs’ northern edge. However, these days the edge is up this way in Frisco. On this once-barren, extremely flat farmland that served primarily as a hayfield lies the still reasonably flat Fazio track (although he moved over 600,000 yards of earth during construction) that is famous for its lightning-fast, Augusta-like putting surfaces. Made up of the new heat-resistant A-4 bentgrass that was installed recently at Fort Worth’s Colonial Country Club, these babies are certain three-jacks if you fail to pay attention to the pin placements with your approach.The greens are the signature at the Stonebriar, since Fazio’s layout is surprisingly hacker-friendly, mostly void of forced carries with fairways framed by mounds that seem to push the ball back into the fairway. The mounding also has a pleasing aesthetic purpose, making it impossible to see the neighboring fairways and greens.The best hole on the front is No. 2, a 407-yard doglegger that tees uphill over a wetland and involves an approach over a creek into a bunker-guarded green.On the back Fazio dropped in a 5-acre lake that comes into play on Nos. 11 and 14, both 400-yard-plus par 4s. Bunkers line the fairway on No. 11, and the hole doglegs right against the wind. Besides the lake on No. 14, the deep, multi-level green is the problem most likely to drive your score up.Getting there : From Hwy. 121 north, take the Legacy Ave. exit and west. The clubhouse is on the left side of the street.",https://www.invitedclubs.com/clubs/stonebriar-country-club,,,,,,
5678,"Trails of Frisco Golf Club, The","The Trails of Frisco golf course is one of Jeff Brauer’s most unique designs -- primarily because it doesn’t fit the mold of his other courses. Brauer, who’s known for his open, straight-forward courses, designed this one to tip out to a par 71, 6,900 yards, loaded it with hidden creeks, scenic wetlands, extensive bunkering, and massive greens. In fact, first-timers will be confused here. They’ll face intimidating views off the tee that leave doubt as to the problems that loom ahead, and it is definitely possible to lose all of your balls off the tee if you’re struggling.The golf course is just flat-out challenging, especially on the front nine. No. 1 opens up with a creek on the left that cuts in front of the green and generally makes its presence known on every shot. The play here is to stay right and stay away from its subtle presence on the left side. The creek comes into play on Nos. 2, 4, 5, and even No. 9, where it chutes from the fairway in front of the green and surrounds the green of this challenging par 4.All told, water and waste areas are in play on 16 of 18 holes (including every par 3), and the creeks are enhanced by visible lakes and ponds on the back side, even though it is considered a bit easier than the front.",https://www.thetrailsoffriscogc.com/,,,,,,
5679,Weston Lakes Country Club,"The tiny town of Fulshear offers an impressive, Carlton Gipson/Hale Irwin-designed golf course for its membership. Ancient pecans line the fairways, and an extensive system of lakes sets the landscape for this long, difficult course. Out-of-bounds lines many holes, and frequent windy conditions make it a challenging task to keep the ball in play.The front nine is highlighted by the mammoth 591-yard, par 5 8th hole, which starts the toughest stretch of golf around the turn. In fact, the top three most difficult rated holes encompass holes 8-10. No. 9 plays 412 yards into the clubhouse, followed by the unwelcome 453-yard par 4 No. 10 after your beer and hot dog at the turn.Getting there : From I-10 west, take the FM 359 exit and drive south. Head west on FM 1093 and drive 2 miles to the course where you'll see the clubhouse on the left side of the road.",https://www.westonlakes.net/,,,,,,
5681,White Wing Golf Club,"White Wing Golf Club opened its first opened with nine holes in June of 2000, and followed shortly thereafter with the complete package. Often compared to the nearby 1996 Legacy Hills, White Wing isn't quite as long, but is definitely more narrow, lined with massive old oak trees, some of which are located right in the middle of the fairway. Many times even if you pure the tee shot down the middle, you'll be forced to hustle a punch shot under one of these majestic trees.Billy Casper's design is known for its challenging par 5s, one of which is the signature finishing hole. No. 18 plays downhill into a split fairway, offering a more aggressive shot to the right that must clear Berry Creek at 210 yards out, which gives you the chance to get home in two. If you play it left, you'll need three good shots to get to the green, one of which will involve dealing with one of the huge oaks that looms in the fairway.White Wing Golf Club's most difficult hole is the par-4 No. 4, which requires an accurate tee shot between fairway bunkers, followed by an approach over a bunker into a multi-level green",https://www.whitewinggolf.com/,,,,,,
5686,Sunshine Country Club Estates,"Sunshine is a private course located in a retirement community that has been open for about 20 years. Of the par 3 courses in the Valley, this is considered one of the best. The course lays out over flat terrain and several lakes come into play, making water hazards the most prominent cause of difficulty.The course wanders through the housing community with a few trees spread throughout the course. Six of the nine holes have water, which is dyed blue for aesthetics. The greens are large and elevated, and grass berms are incorporated into the design to add character.The most difficult hole is No. 9, mainly because it is the longest at 161 yards. Also, there's water to the right and behind the green, as well as a large tree beside the lake that catches errant shots. The best birdie opportunity is No. 8.Other notes: There is no formal pro shop. Guest fees are voluntary and there is a box to slip the payment in.Getting there : From McAllen, take Hwy 83 east to Hwy 77. Turn north and drive 3 miles to the course. The entrance is on the right.",https://www.sunshinecountryclub.com/,,,,,,

Built on rolling terrain, the wide fairways present nice targets off the tee, and the elevated greens require taking an extra club every now and then. While not an overbearing factor, water hazards come into play throughout the design.Getting there : From Hwy 77 driving south, exit on Ed Carey and turn left. When you come to Business 77 turn right, drive down to Trailer Hills Blvd. and turn left. Veer right at the split in the road and turn left on Pinehurst, where you'll see signs to the course.",http://treasurehillsgolfclub.com/,,,,,,
5690,Tangle Oaks Golf Club,"Former Haskell Country Club superintendent Mark Bailey and his wife Gayle first broke ground for this course northeast of Hawley on New Year’s Day, 1996. Two and half years later, the original nine holes opened. Construction on the next nine wrapped up in 2002, leaving 18 outstanding holes for the public.Tangle Oaks is an appropriate name. The course is carved out of an extremely dense oak thicket, sometimes referred to as “the shinnery.” In fact, the shinnery is so thick that it’s played as a lateral hazard– players just drop from where the ball went into the briar-patch-like rough. Length is not imperative, but accuracy is key. The greens are elevated, tilt from back to front, and have a medium to high slope.The fairways are quite tight, due to the oaks. The strategy is simple. Keep it straight or you'll get in trouble. Length is not important, but accuracy is a must.The signature hole is No. 9, a 383-yard par 4 that plays into the teeth of the stiff west Texas wind. To further a golfer's sheer terror, the green is completely fronted by water and a formidable retaining wall. On the back the most notable hole is No. 13, which features an island green. Hole 18 is unique because of the split fairway.Other notes: The county is dry, but Tangle Oaks allows you to bring your own beer. While most of the play comes from Abilene, many visiting hunters chase game afield early in the morning, then play golf in the afternoon.Getting there : Call the course for more detailed directions, as they may be able to give you a better feel for finding this out-of-the-way course. From Abilene, drive north on Hwy 277 to Hawley. Go east at Exit 1226, and drive 6 miles to the course.",,,,,,,
5691,Texaco Country Club,"Originally opened as a 9-holer in 1924 for the Texas Co., TCC is the oldest existing private course in Houston that is still in its current location. Another nine was added in 1938, creating the full golf experience with a design that incorporated the unusual Cypress Pond. The pond is loaded with lily pads and cypress trees, which complements this traditional track quite well. The greens are small and undulating-difficult targets but fairly reasonable two-putts.No. 11 is the toughest hole at 563 yards. Considered one of the best holes in the Houston area, it's a double dogleg that has lots of trees and Greens Bayou to boot.Getting there : From I-10 going east, get off at the Federal Rd. exit and make a left.

5697,Walden on Lake Houston Golf & Country Club,"Patterned after the successful Robert Von Hagge/Bruce Devlin-designed Walden on Lake Conroe, this course opened in 1982 and immediately became known for its numerous bunkers and lakes. Considered a shotmaker's course, this layout features over 100 bunkers and requires precise play throughout.Holes of note are the intimidating opening hole-a long, bending par 4 with a lake guarding the right side. Beware of the pin placement on this multi-tiered green. No. 8 is a 429-yard par 4 that requires a long drive and perfect approach because of the channel that guards the tiny, bunker-loaded green. On the back No. 14 is the best, dominated by a large lake in the fairway. At 444 yards it also requires a challengingly long approach into a small green.Getting there : From U.S. Hwy. 59 north, take the FM 1960 exit and go east for 8 miles to the course.

His links-style terrain features some of the natural wetlands as well as additional water hazards.These wetlands are evident on holes 4-6, a picturesque stretch where alligators roam and errant balls are usually gone forever. No. 9 is the most challenging, a 447-yard par 4 lined on the left by the bayou. It features an approach over a lake that fronts the green.Getting there : From I-10 west, take the Fry Rd. exit and turn left.

5714,Walden on Lake Conroe Golf & Country Club,"Long considered the best course in the Houston area, Walden rolls through a spectacular setting on the southwest shores of Lake Conroe and offers one of the most memorable golf experiences in Texas.The course was designed by Robert von Hagge and Bruce Devlin, who moved over 300,000 cubic yards of earth to extend the lakefront property. This famous spot is now home to the unforgettable 589-yard double dogleg, which rounds out the impressive stretch of par 5 holes that make up Nos. 9-11.More about No. 11: A draw is preferable off the tee, avoiding the trees and out-of-bounds that guard the left side. The key second shot should be a fairway wood left, avoiding Lake Conroe that comes into play on the right. If that shot is solid you'll face a 120-150 yard approach over the lake to a green that slopes back to front. Watch the wind and don't be afraid to take a bogey, as this is one of the finest, most difficult holes in Texas.Getting there : From I-45 north, take Hwy. 105 ( Exit 87) and head west.

The short design features generous fairways and prominent bunkering around the undulating greens. Lakes and ponds have been added over the years and impact play on most holes. Trees have also been added over the years to spice up the flat, prairie-like course.No. 9 is one of the toughest holes, a 440-yard par 4 that doglegs and has water.

Packard returned in 1990 to add a fourth nine, leaving the course with two 18-hole layouts.Both are short courses that put a premium on accuracy. The Pecan Course is a more traditional and longer than the Cypress Course, with water in play on 12 holes. The Cypress Course features more mounding in the fairways.Getting there : From Hwy. 59 south, take the Sweetwater Blvd exit and turn left. When you come to Palm Royale Blvd., turn right and drive a short distance to the course. The entrance is on the left.",https://www.swcclub.com/,,,,,,
5747,Sulphur Springs Country Club,"Sulphur Springs C.C. is a short, semi-private track whose small greens require precision approach shots. The front nine is the easier of the two sides and offers plenty of birdie chances, including two short par 3s and a pair of par 5s that play under 500 yards.The Billy Martindale-designed back features water on six of nine holes. The highlight is No. 18, a 335- yard par 4 that features water along the right side, including a portion that necks into the fairway at about 150 yards from the tee.Getting there : From I-30 going east, take Exit 127 and go 3 miles down the access road. The course is on the right side of the road.",https://www.sulphurspringscc.com/,,,,,,
5750,Sweetwater Country Club,"Sweetwater’s 18-hole semi-private country club course does not require length, as the middle tees play under 6,000 yards. Built on gently rolling terrain, the course features tree-lined fairways, water hazards that impact a few holes, and small Champion Bermuda greens that were installed in the mid-1990s.The toughest hole is the par 4, 425-yard No. 8. However many of the other par 4s are well under 400 yards. Not only are there birdie opportunities on the short par 4s, but all of the par 3s are under 200 yards, three of which should require no more than a medium-length iron. Hit the greens on the par 3s and you’re assured of a respectable round.Getting there : From I-20 west, exit Sweetwater Business and turn left on East Broadway. When you come to Hailey turn right, then proceed down to Woodruff. Turn (? ) and this road leads directly to the course.",,,,,,,
5751,T-Bar Country Club,"Built in the late 1950s, the semi-private T-Bar is a flat course with minimal trees, so the wind bears down hard. Hole 6 is the signature at 411 yards, featuring a tee shot is into a narrow landing area. No. 7 is also difficult and requires some nifty short game work. The bent-grass greens are in nice shape and hold shots well. As you might expect, the fairways are firm and the grass can get bare in some areas. Overall, a fun course to play because of its open layout.Getting there : Turn west off of Hwy. 87 and take Hwy. 380 until you come to T-Bar Lane. Drive north 2 miles to the course.",,,,,,,
5753,Wildflower Country Club,"Wildflower opened in 1987, and is one of Leon Howard’s better designs, featuring outstanding views of the central Texas landscapes, loads of water, and some of the best holes in this part of the state. While Howard established a reputation for basic, down-and-dirty courses in the 60s and 70s, this modern, challenging track is more of a complete golf experience.The design incorporates numerous water hazards, including many natural ponds that grace the rolling terrain. The fairways are fairly generous, and most of the greens have deceptive undulations.During the round you’ll notice the long, challenging par 4s. Particularly the 405 yard No. 11, where a creek cuts into the fairway twice, framing the landing area off the tee. No. 3 is also tough, playing 446 yards and forcing another carry of a creek that cuts into the fairway. The 17th is another solid par 4–not as long, but picturesque because the green is completely surrounded by water.Finally, the feature that rounds out the experience at Wildflower is the great condition of the course, enhanced by the new irrigation system that keeps the fairways lush and the greens healthy and rolling true.Getting there : From I-35 north, exit Midway Drive and turn left. Drive approximately 2 miles and turn right on Wildflower Lane.",https://www.invitedclubs.com/clubs/wildflower-country-club,,,,,,

Added in 2001, the Tribute is the newer of the two but it has quickly made a name for itself. In addition to being a challenge, the course also offers picturesque scenery on almost every hole. There is very little water on the golf course but the layout doesn't need it with its variety of elevation changes and numerous strategically placed sand bunkers situated along the greensides and fairways. The course demands accuracy and length, making it a formidable test for even seasoned players but players of all skill levels will enjoy the unrivaled scenery regardless of their score. The third hole is one of the most scenic holes in northern Michigan, and it also provides a great birdie opportunity.",https://www.otsegoclub.com/,,,,,,

Play it smart and take an extra club on most approaches because of the elevated greens.The most difficult hole is the 500-yard No. 16, a par 5 that forces two carries over water hazards and a green that is covered by bunkers.Getting there : From I-20, take Hwy. 69 south, then turn right on Loop 323.

The par 3s are considered the easiest holes on the course; however, one goes 223 yards. The par 4s play just under 400 yards, including the number one handicap at 370 yards.Other notes: Walk-ons are welcome here, as it never takes too much time to get on the course.

5776,Wichita Falls Country Club,"Fred Cooper, a Scottish immigrant, failed to find a suitable place to pursue his passion for golf when he settled in Wichita Falls in the early 1900s. So in 1914, the Wichita Falls Golf Club was formed with a 9-hole course and clubhouse on Victory Street.The club prospered through the 1920s, then fell on hard times during the Depression and was eventually turned over to the mortgage company in 1935. After several attempts to reorganize the club, Solon Featherston bought the entire club, made many improvements (first bent-grass greens in North Texas), and brought the facility back to profitability–due in part to slot machines installed during his tenure.The layout features a good mixture of holes, with a creek winding its way through the course and coming into play on more than half of the holes. A small lake also impacts a few holes. The fairways are tree-lined and there is a moderate amount of bunkering. While some tee shots require the precision for target golf, others are wide-open and offer generous landing areas.In late 1994, holes 14 and 15 were renovated. Jeff Brauer and Ralph Plummer have done work here periodically over the years.Make note of Ladies Day on Thursdays, as only ladies may tee off until 11:00 AM.Getting there : From Hwy 287 north, turn right at Midwestern, then drive 2 miles to the course.

5777,Texas National Golf Club,"Referred to as “the best piece of land left in America close to a downtown” by architect Tom Fazio, ultra-exclusive Dallas National sets a new standard for golf in Dallas. Created with the aim of obtaining a major championship, the course opened in 2002 in an amazing spot just 6 miles southeast of downtown in old Oak Cliff.The land itself was once owned by a cement company that was unable to effectively use the land, and the city of Dallas refused to zone the area because of an escarpment that slices the landscape. Result: the perfect opportunity to use the terrain for golf. But this isn’t just your normal run-of-the-mill upscale daily-fee development. The big boys play here--guys like Tom Hicks and Roger Staubach--and the price tag is rumored to be upwards of $160,000 to become one of 350 members.The high price tag, Fazio name, superb location, and stunning landscape combine to make one of the highest-profile facilities that has ever graced the great state of Texas. Dallasites would be shocked to learn of the spectacular elevation changes that reside so close to their flat city. Tipping out at over 7,300 yards, the par 72 track spreads out over almost 400 acres of limestone canyons, winding creek beds, and large plateaus, with up to 160 feet of elevation changes.Every hole is a signature hole, with Fazio’s signature bunkers defining the immaculate zoysia fairways. The natural appearance of the course is accentuated by the subtle reddish-tan cart paths, and artistic wooden bridges span the limestone ravines. Many holes offer elevated tees and impressive views of the city.And while the USGA gave the course one of the highest slope ratings ever (155), which is sure to help the club attract a big-time tournament, wealthy hacks can enjoy themselves from one of the other six remaining sets of tees.Getting there : Just east of Loop 12 between Keeneland Pkwy. and Jefferson Blvd. south of I-30.",https://www.dallasnationalgolfclub.com/,,,,,,
5778,Squaw Creek Golf Club,"Ralph Plummer built this in the early 1970s for employees of the Lockheed Martin plant, but today Squaw Creek is open to the public. Its namesake creek runs through the property, and the course is popular because of its sloping, bermuda grass greens. Walkers might have a rough go of it, as the terrain is fairly rugged and there are significant elevation changes.Playing from the tips, you’ll face quite a few 400-yard-plus par 4s, and a pair of par 3s that are over 200 yards. The number one handicap is the 595-yard No. 16.Getting there : From I-30 west, take the 418 exit and turn right on Ranch House Rd. The entrance is on the left side of the road.",https://www.squaw-creek.com/,,,,,,
5779,Windcrest Golf Club,"Formerly a private club, Windcrest Golf Club is now open for public play. This nine-hole course is tight in some spots with a traditional layout that calls for a variety of different shots. Tree-lined fairways and elevated greens protected by bunkers require sharp short game skills and accurate placement off the tees. Water hazards also come into play on two holes. With four sets of tees, the golf course is perfect for juniors and beginners who want some practice or avid golfers wanting a quick round. One of the most appealing things about Windcrest Golf Club is that it doesn't get especially crowded on weekends, meaning tee times are rarely required.",http://www.windcrestgolfclub.com/,,,,,,
5780,Webb Hill Country Club,"Funeral home man and golf fan Bobby Owens led the development of Webb Hill CC in 1969, and the Leon Howard-designed 18-hole course has served Wolfe City ever since. This course is heavily wooded, with narrow, undulating fairways and a good combination of interesting tee shots. Howard’s design involves a few blind tee shots that play uphill, as well as a few from elevated tees that offer good views of the holes ahead. Water comes into play on half the holes, and the large greens are of medium speed.No. 8 is the signature, playing 590 yards and requiring two tough shots down a swerving fairway lined by a lake. The approach is nasty because of the skinny green that is covered by trees.Getting there : From I-30 east towards Greenville, take Hwy. 34 north to FM 2358.

Originally opened as a nine-hole course in 1971, the second nine was added a few years later and in 2009, the course opened its doors to the public. The layout was designed by A.V. Macan, who contributed several notable courses throughout the Pacific Northwest including Firecrest in Tacoma and Broadmoor in Seattle. Sunland is known for its plush fairways and well manicured greens. The layout can be challenging if hitting straight isn't your strong suit. The landing areas are quite narrow with homes and cedar trees throughout the course. In addition to the golf course, Sunland also boasts one of the best practice facilities on the Olympic Peninsula, which includes an expansive outdoor driving range with grass tees.",https://sunlandgolf.com/,,,,,,

Couples clearly favors traditional golf designs, as this one is pure old-school. A whopping six sets of tees allow just about anyone to enjoy the game at this exclusive club.The front side features the most difficult rated hole-the 473-yard No. 7, which tees over water and involves a tricky approach into a green protected by water left and back. The fairway snakes on No. 7, which creates some deceptive angles from which to approach the hole.On the back, Couples mixed it up well by offering an easier stretch of golf on holes 13-16, which consist of two relatively short par 4s and a pair of reasonable par 3s.Getting there : Take Beltway 8 south from I-10 to Westheimer.

Elaborate hills and greenside swales protect many of the putting complexes. The putting surfaces on the front nine are relatively calm when compared to the back nine where most of the greens are double-tiered, ridged, or layered. The par-4 15th is one of Stonebridge Golf Club's most scenic and challenging holes. With water in front, back, and right of the green, this is one of the toughest approaches on the back nine.",https://stonebridgegolfclub.net/,,,,,,

6239,Wolf Creek Golf Resort,"Tucked away in a small mountain valley on the eastern side of Ogden's Wasatch Mountains is one of the best courses in the state. It is scenic, challenging, well maintained and isn't as busy as most courses in Northern Utah.The reason that the course is not as busy is that it is a little more than an hour away from Salt Lake City and there isn't an Interstate running to it. But with the highway construction happening now in the city you can probably drive to Wolf Creek faster than you can across town.Wolf Creek is located in the rolling hills just below the canyon that leads to the Powder Mountain Ski Resort. The high mountains surround everything in sight and the area is very scenic. In addition to the golf course Wolf Creek includes condos and time share units for summer and winter vacationers.The course is a mountain style course with elevated tees, sloped terrain and lots of wild areas in which to lose your ball. Wildlife is often seen on the course including deer, moose and fox. A more common critter on the course is the garter snake. They are harmless but can give you a scare if you disturb one hiding hiding in the long grass.Wolf Creek is probably one of the top five toughest courses in Utah. It's tough because of it's playing length, not it's actual length. On the card, the tee lengths of 6845 (gold) and 6465 (blue) don't seem to be outrageous, but the way the holes use the yardage will make you think a 300 yard drive is required to score well.Several of the toughest par 4 holes in Utah are on Wolf Creek. Numbers 3, 7 and 18 are well over 400 yards long and each has an up sloping fairway to an elevated green. Long uphill second shots put fairway woods into the hands of all but the longest players. And once you reach the greens in regulation you still have to putt out on fast greens that break severely toward the valley bottom.Other long holes include the par 3s. All but one of them is in the 180+ range and two of them have long carries over water. The par 5s are the most manageable holes but even they have elevated greens making the holes play longer.The fairways are generally wider on the holes that require long tee shots, but all holes have plenty of places that provide lost and unplayable lies. The front 9 seems to be wide open as there are very few trees, but the long meadow grasses off the fairways will hide a ball as well as the thick woods on the back 9.Be cautious when driving from the elevated tees. Since the ball flies further after being hit from high above the landing area, the distance a miss-hit shot draws or fades will be exaggerated and you could end up missing the fairway. This is especially true on holes 1 and 10.Wolf Creek Golf Course is a tough challenge for the best golfers without being overly penal for mid handicap golfers. Beginners may find it over powering. Although the green fees are about $5 more than the average public course, Wolf Creek Golf resort offers a great value for the experienced golfer.",http://www.wolfcreekgolfutah.com/,,,,,,

There are some water hazards that come into play in the form of a lake and bunkers protect several of the greens. Long, straight shots are needed to do well at Oakridge Country Club.

The par-70 layout has both links-style holes and more traditional, tree-lined holes. The front nine is more player friendly.

By far the layout's most formidable challenges come from the deep, stacked pot bunkers that make it truly feel like a classic Scottish golf course. There are also water hazards on a few holes. The course's signature is the par-4 third hole, which is long but plays downhill all the way. The 10th hole, another par 4, is one of the toughest.

Skillful players could even try to use the contours to their advantage. Each hole has a bunkers but the bunkering is not excessive. In addition to the mounding and bunkering, the undulating terrain provides natural elevation changes. The golf course finishes with what is arguably its toughest hole. This monster par 5 is 620 yards from the back tees. It requires a drive over a ravine with a natural waste area to the left.

The Blue nine features a few holes with water and there are a few strategically placed bunkers to contend with.

6752,Koshkonong Mounds Country Club,"Tucked amongst the rolling hills along the eastern shores of its namesake lake, Koshkonong Mounds Country Club pays homage to the Winnebago tribes that are native to the area. Koshkonong is a word from their language that means ""these waters we live on."" The club was established in 1870 on land that was once known as the country's premier duck hunting destination. The golf course was constructed in 1922 and still stands as Fort Atkinson's only 18-hole layout. The historic Indian effigy mounds were carefully preserved and incorporated into the course as navigational hazards. The golf course is a formidable test in addition to being scenic with plenty of blinds shots in store thanks to the dramatic elevation changes. Golfers should also be prepared for uneven lies. Both distance and accuracy are required for scoring well at Koshkonong Mounds Country Club.",https://www.kmccgolf.com/,,,,,,

It is not as well known as some other courses in the area and might possibly one of the state's best-kept secrets. The golf course stretches to more than 7,000 yards from the tips and was ranked as one of Wisconsin's top 20 toughest courses. Mature trees shape the numerous doglegs and there are also water hazards that come into play throughout Fire Ridge. There is an interesting mix of holes including challenging par 4s, with the most difficult being the 16th. There are no surprises on this tricky hole because it's tough enough on its own. Golfers should aim to keep it in the fairway and place the second shot below the hole, making sure not to miss the green long or else they're be facing a fast downhill chip shot.",https://www.fireridgegc.com/,,,,,,

Nestled in the resort community of Green Lake, the course enjoys a landscape of majestic evergreens, maples, and towering oaks. The layout is routed through a maze of mature trees, they line the tight fairways and frame the demanding greens. There is also thick rough to contend with as well as strategically placed bunkers. The classic layout is more challenging than what you would expect from a traditional golf course from that era. It demands accuracy as well as skillful course management but it is a fair test that is still player-friendly enough for beginners to approach with confidence.

6783,Hartford Golf Club,"Hartford Golf Club is conveniently located just outside of Milwaukee. The course has been a part of the community since 1928 when a group of local businessmen who were passionate about golf decided to come together and make the course a reality. The layout is traditional in design and player friendly enough for beginners, but it still offers a few challenges. It's a short golf course by modern standards, measuring 6,519 yards from the back tees. Water isn't terribly prominent, but golfers should be prepared for back-to-back water hazards starting with the third hole. Hartford Golf Club's 12th hole is the longest on the course at 570 yards and this dogleg left is also one of the toughest. In addition to the golf course, there are also two full-length driving ranges and a three-hole practice course.",https://hartfordgolfclubwi.com/,,,,,,

The distinctive layout will test your creative shot-making skills. It may seem relatively short at 6,111 yards from the back tees but it feels much longer thanks to the rolling fairways and undulating greens. The tight fairways are lined with cliffs, brush, and trees, leaving little room for error. You should also be prepared for forced carries and tricky doglegs.

Thankfully, this monster is void of hazards. On the back No. 13 is feast or famine–a short par 5 at 483 yards, but a pond sits in the middle of the fairway. The ender at Cedar Creek goes 520 yards and is fairly manageable if you can keep it out of the trees.Getting there : From Hwy. 175 east, take the Kemp exit, and look for the signs to the course.",http://www.cedarcreekcountryclub.com/,,,,,,

At 6,356 yards from the back tees, it is shorter than most championship courses you will find today but the layout still has plenty to offer besides length. There is a mix of holes that are wide-open and some that are framed by stands of mature trees. The rolling terrain provides subtle but tricky undulations in the greens and fairways as well as the occasional double-tiered green. One of the most memorable holes for both its level of difficulty and the scenery is the par-4 third.

The golf course is quite short at 5,881 yards, which makes it pleasantly walkable, but it is certainly not an easy course. The front nine plays across rolling hills while the back nine is centered upon the manmade Lake Wisconsin. The bunkering throughout the golf course is minimal, but it is strategic and fair. The small, fast greens have enough undulations to give them some character but they are not overly difficult though the tricky doglegs shaped by stands of mature trees will test your accuracy. The par-3 12th hole is the signature thanks to a challenging island tee. Lake Wisconsin Country Club's 16th hole also has a memorable tee shot between two towering oak trees followed by a short iron to a well guarded green that backs onto the Wisconsin River.",https://www.lakewisconsincc.com/,,,,,,

The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is.

At only 6,300 yards from the back tees, it is shorter than most modern championship golf courses but don't let the yardage fool you. This course will test you on even its shortest holes. Every hole features either out-of-bounds or a lateral water hazard on one or both sides.

Despite the difference in age and length, both golf courses provide rounds that are as scenic as they are challenging. The Springs is a Robert Trent Jones design, although the lush terrain of the Wisconsin River Valley also deserves credit. The course sweeps along the valley floor and incorporates Jones signature elements, including narrow landing areas and plenty of bunkering. Water hazards also come into play on almost every hole.

The front nine is slightly more forgiving than the back nine where the fairways are narrower and many are lined with out-of-bounds stakes.

Opened in 1956, the 18-hole course has a traditional layout that is shorter than most modern courses. Despite the relatively short length, there are plenty of challenges in store on this golf course. The greens are severely sloped and they play lightning fast. More often than not, you'll find that they're flanked by strategically placed bunkers as well. There are also water hazards that come into play on several holes. The golf course appeals to a wide range of skill levels since it's not overly punishing for high handicappers and there are risk-reward opportunities for more advanced players.

It offers two 18-hole golf courses and one nine-hole course. Dick Wilson originally designed the Blue Course in 1958, but in 2004 Rees Jones did a complete renovation. Jones reshaped all of the course's greens, creating several with multiple tiers, and he also rebuilt many of the tees, which are all now square. The fairways and greenside bunkers were completely reconstructed as well to provide a greater challenge. The signature hole is the par-4 16th, which poses a formidable threat since it plays right into prevailing wind. The 14th is also memorable for its treacherous water hazard.",https://rmgc.org/,,,,,,

The aptly chosen name translates to 'giant,' referencing the stunning cliffs surrounding the course. The layout is comprised of multiple levels of plateaus that offer panoramic view of the boreal forest and meandering streams that cover the landscape. The golf course is one of two at the resort, the other being Le Diable, or the Devil. While the other course may draw inspiration from it, Le Geant is definitely a more difficult challenge. Although it is shorter, every component of its layout including the numerous sand bunkers, were meticulously placed to provide the greatest challenge.",https://www.tremblant.ca/,,,,,,
8178,Le Chateau Montebello,"Neighbor to the Laurentian Mountains, the Fairmont Le Chateau Montebello Golf Club tumbles across a dramatic, rolling landscape. The course tightly winds through towering forests, which not only provides some challenging holes but also ensures a secluded, closed-in feel. Originally designed by Stanley Thompson in 1929, it has become one of the most popular golf courses in Quebec. In 1998, the scenic course was designated as an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary. The layout is considered one of the toughest in the province. The elevation changes throughout the course offer scenic mountain views but they also guarantee that a flat lie will be hard to find. There are a few water hazards on the golf course but the challenge comes mostly from the well guarded greens. In addition to the course, there is also a driving range and chipping and putting greens.",https://www.fairmont.com/montebello/golf/montebello-golf-course/,,,,,,

It is not often played or heard of because the club is reputed to be one of the most exclusive in the country. The golf course is laid across the east slope of Mount Bruno. The tree-lined fairways and heavily bunkered greens carefully follow the natural undulation of the landscape, featuring a good amount of elevation changes that often cause the ball the break in a different direction than what you're expecting. Mount Bruno's signature hole is the par-4 13th, which sits at the highest point on the course, offering a spectacular view of the surrounding valley. The tee shot plays downhill and then requires an uphill approach to an elevated green that slopes to the left and is flanked by bunkers on the right.",https://secure.gggolf.ca/mountbruno/index.php?lang=en,,,,,,

The water features pose only a minimal threat but they provide some memorable holes, especially the 13th, which is the best par 3 on the golf course. A stream cuts across this uphill hole where after crossing a bridge, golfers will face a green flanked with bunkers on either side as well as trees to the back.

The lush landscape is covered in trees, mosses, ferns, and grasses. The front nine was designed in 1921 and the back nine was added 30 years later making it a full-length championship golf course.

Water hazards come into play on five holes and there are white sand bunkers throughout the golf course. Bay of Quinte Golf & Country Club's signature hole is the par-4 15th, which features an elevated tee that plays to a well protected green that is surrounded by a tree, bunkers to the left, and mounding to the back and sides.

Southbrook Golf & Country Club now plays to a 6,560 yards and its new challenges demand precision and keen course strategy.

8512,Fairview Golf & Country Club,"Heritage Ranch serves up an especially challenging par 72, 6,988-yard Arthur Hills design that rolls through the oaks and pecans just outside of Fairview. And while it’s part of a gated, active-adult residential community, the course is open to the public and especially fun because it integrates well with the neighborhood. Houses line some fairways, but a fair number of holes provide that natural, rural feel that is always so welcome on a golf course.While the course is not particularly demanding off the tees, the real challenge at Heritage Ranch comes from the mound-shaped greens. If your irons aren’t dialed in, you’ll be working hard for ups and downs.No. 1 is a unique opener because it bends left down to a fairway and green that aren’t visible from the tee. Big drives can get close, but the recommended play is to take a long iron and draw it over the hill.The par 5s on the front are nice holes. No. 3 doglegs right and requires a good tee shot, followed by a relatively easy second shot into a widening fairway toward the hole. The trick is nailing the short iron (almost a blind shot) into the elevated green guarded by bunkers on the front. No. 7 is longer and offers a good chance for birdie, again because of its wide-open nature.No. 16 is the signature hole: a par 3 masterpiece that plays along a natural spring waterfall. You’ll need to nail a long iron over the valley and avoid the trees that overhang the fairway from the right.No. 18 is a good finisher–it’s a long par 4 that doglegs left around a few large fairway bunkers, then works its way uphill to an elevated, mound-shaped green surrounded by bunkers. Ups and downs are possible here if you miss the green back left, which is easy to do when you approach with a fairway wood.Getting there : Only 20 miles northeast of Dallas, take I-75 north to the Stacy Road exit, then turn right and drive to the dead end. The road jogs to the left, then right, and continues as Stacy Road. The entrance is 2 miles down on the left.",https://www.heritageranchgolf.com/,,,,,,

9296,"Olching, Golfclub","Welcome!A sporting challenge awaits you.The 18-hole championship course was built in 1980/81 according to the plans of Dudok van Heel and renovated and modernized by Thomas Himmel in 2012/13.Located in a floodplain landscape of the Amper, the course today presents itself as a quiet park landscape and impresses with the modern architecture of the greens and bunkers.While the natural trees and the numerous lakes are the defining design elements of the course, the sporting concept is essentially determined by wind and strategically placed obstacles.Another special feature is the natural undulations on the fairways and should the ball stray off the fairways, there is a strong rough lurking there in which (almost) every ball can be found, but can only be played on with skill.The golf club has made it its mission to maintain and care for the facilities and character of this floodplain landscape as ""purely"" as possible and for this reason treats natural resources very carefully and cautiously. The DGV Golf & Nature certificate in silver confirms this success.A varied round of golf awaits you on a course that will give you a lot of pleasure, but also requires a tactical game.We hope you have a great game!",https://www.golfclubolching.de/,,,,,,

9317,"Bad Bevensen, Golf Club","Golf course""Golf is a way to find yourself""The Held family deliberately chose this motto from Rymond Federman for the Bad Bevensen golf course: The course, in the middle of a rural idyll, invites you to relax and play golf in a family atmosphere.As soon as you arrive at the course in the Secklendorf district, you feel like you're on vacation: The long oak avenue paved with cobblestones leads to a half-timbered Lower Saxon farm, horses neigh, and an antique shop invites you to browse. Past the beautiful things, you walk along the oak grove to the clubhouse - in true half-timbered style.A friendly welcome, perhaps a quick purchase in the pro shop, and then you can start your round. The precise allocation of starting times - even during the week - means there is no crowding at the tee.After a few strokes on the driving range and a few skillful chips and putts, you head to the first tee. You get a first impression of the course at tee 1: a dogleg to the right over meadows means that many a short tiger line drive disappears among the Heidschnucken. Precise play is required across the entire course, scattered drives quickly end up in the dense forest, in the numerous bunkers and lakes. A course that is certainly difficult; played tactically, however, it is an absolute must for every golfer. Add to that the beautiful heath landscape through which the 18 completely differently designed holes with their well-kept fairways and greens run. After the game, you can relax wonderfully on the club terrace with a view of the course. Anyone who wants to can join one another at the long tables. The boss is also always up for a chat. He is happy to talk about the beginnings at the club, the daily maintenance of the course or give tips for your own game.A successful day of golf is coming to an end - a shame, actually, some holes could certainly have been played differently...",https://www.gc-badbevensen.de/,,,,,,

This monster doglegs left inside a cliff that runs along the right side. Out-of-bounds is left, and a fairway bunker resides about a lob wedge from the narrow green, which is bolstered from behind by more bunkers.No. 18 is one of the more interesting finishing holes that you’ll come across, featuring two dogleg fairways, one right and one left, that both involve dealing with the creek that splits the two routes. The tee shot right is more favorable, since it is void of fairway bunkers like the ones on the left side. However, this option involves carrying two bunkers and the creek on the approach.Getting there : From I-20 west, take the Bryant/Irvin Rd. exit and turn left. Drive 2.5 miles to the course.

The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times.

10332,"Colony Country Club, The","Perhaps one day the greatness that is Crown Colony will finally supplant Fort Worth's Colonial Country Club as Texas' finest golf course. For now this course, which opened in the late 1970s, may have to wait a few more decades for its legend to grow. The course is certainly worthy, offering immaculate conditions paired with demanding target golf. Water is in play on 13 holes, the pine-lined fairways feature numerous elevation changes, and the greens are small targets.The best hole on the front is No. 4, about a 180-yarder all over water, but you're bound to notice the opening set of holes that feature two monster par 5s. The 583-yard No. 3 bends left around a lake and plays to a tricky little green nestled against water's edge.On the back, you'll remember the ender-an almost 600-yard tree-lined monster. And the preceding 203-yard No. 17 isn't the way to build confidence for the finisher. Together the two finishing holes can absolutely destroy your round.Getting there : From Houston, take Hwy. 59 north. Exit Champions Dr. and you will see the course.",https://crown-colony.site/,,,,,,

Thomas, Jr., who created the Riviera, collaborated with Billy Bell to design the original golf course but Jay Morrish made the layout considerably more challenging with renovations in 1988. Ten years later, two holes from the original Thomas/Bell layout that were lost during a redesign following WWII were completely restored and incorporated into the layout.

Starting from one of golf’s most iconic first-tee perches, the golfer descends, climbs and winds through valleys, over barrancas that come into play on several holes and finally uphill to the amphitheater 18th green.Riviera is home to one of the game’s most recognizable par 3s and one of its great short par 4s. The former is the short 6th hole, with a pot bunker in the middle of the sweeping, multi-tiered green. The latter: the 10th, whose broad fairway and strategic bunkering gives way to one of the toughest-to-hit putting surfaces in the world. Even the best golfers in the world routinely make scores from 2 to 8 there.In addition to the PGA Tour’s annual Genesis Invitational, Riviera has a considerable major championship pedigree, including a U.S. Open (1948) and two PGA Championships (1983, 1995).",https://www.therivieracountryclub.com/,,,,,,

The holes are played in three different 18-hole combinations that tumble across sandy dunes and grassy hollows. The natural contours of the coastal landscape largely determined the movement and flow of all three nine-hole courses. The nines, Grizzle, Kodiak, and Black Bear, all have winding fairways bordered by native wetland grasses and lush, oversized greens that boast some of the best conditions on the Eastern Shore. The Black Bear/Grizzly combination is the longest of the three golf courses. Not only does the coastal terrain provide many natural hazards, including several water features, there are also strategically placed bunkers with which to contend.",https://www.beartrapdunes.com/,,,,,,
10989,Kings Creek Country Club,"From the tips, Kings Creek can play particularly tough because of the prevailing winds off the shores of Cedar Creek Lake. However, on calm days this course can be had, since the layout is fairly basic and features water on only six holes. In the late 1980s, the course became known for its improving condition, and that reputation has held true over the years.The front nine is shorter and a little easier than the front, its toughest hole being the 200 -yard No. 3 over water. No. 14 typifies the longer back: a 576-yard marathon with water on either side of the fairway.Getting there : From Dallas, take I-175 south, then turn right on Hwy. 274. The course is 2 miles down the road.",https://www.kccountryclub.com/,,,,,,

The par-70 layout is player friendly enough for beginners but low handicappers will also find it to be a fun round. The holes are fairly straightforward though there are some fairways that have very narrow landing areas that will test the accuracy of even the best golfers. Numerous bunkers are strategically placed along the undulating greens and water also comes into play on the occasional hole. The golf course starts out gently but becomes progressively more challenging on the back nine. The most memorable hole on the golf course, the par-3 12th, is a water hole that features an intimidating island green.",https://wheelertraditions.com/,,,,,,

The par 3s are tough and the diverse par 4s come in all shapes and sizes. Royal Lakes Golf & C.C. is a shot maker's layout that requires accuracy and thoughtful strategy. The most memorable hole on the golf course is the par-5 11th, which features an intimidating island green.",https://www.hugedomains.com/domain_profile.cfm?d=royallakesgolf.com,,,,,,

The two hired the eclectic Scotsman Desmond Muirhead to design the course on 190 acres of former cotton fields.In the 1980s, the LPGA and Senior PGA tours frequently hosted tournaments at Bent Tree, and the course was eventually renovated in 1990. The improvements focused on the front nine (which is still more open than the back), spicing up the layout with bunkering, tree additions, and adjustments to greens.Water comes into play on 14 of 18 holes, and the course is quite long if you play from the tips. The best hole on the front is No. 3, a long par 5 that plays almost 600 yards. The narrow fairway chutes between water on the left and bunkers on the right, and the small green slopes severely to the water on the left side.The more interesting back nine offers a nice stretch of golf on holes 13-15. No. 14 is the most scenic on the course because it plays downhill at least 75 feet to a green surrounded on three sides by water. The 387-yard 18th is the perfect finishing hole–not too long but plenty challenging.Getting there : From I-635 east, take the Dallas North Tollway and exit Westgrove.

Mature trees frame many of the holes and there are several strategically placed bunkers lurking throughout.

For example, a well executed shot placed near a hazard is rewarded with less club to the green or a better approach angle, or even both.

The rolling elevations also provide picturesque views from nearly every point on golf course.

While Howard established a reputation for basic, down-and-dirty courses in the 60s and 70s, this modern, challenging track is more of a complete golf experience.The design incorporates numerous water hazards, including many natural ponds that grace the rolling terrain. The fairways are fairly generous, and most of the greens have deceptive undulations.During the round you’ll notice the long, challenging par 4s. Particularly the 405 yard No. 11, where a creek cuts into the fairway twice, framing the landing area off the tee. No. 3 is also tough, playing 446 yards and forcing another carry of a creek that cuts into the fairway. The 17th is another solid par 4–not as long, but picturesque because the green is completely surrounded by water.Finally, the feature that rounds out the experience at Wildflower is the great condition of the course, enhanced by the new irrigation system that keeps the fairways lush and the greens healthy and rolling true.Getting there : From I-35 north, exit Midway Drive and turn left.

Laid out along the Nueces River, River Hills is a short course with water hazards coming into play on almost half the holes. The design features narrow fairways and average-sized greens of medium speed.The 382-yard par 4 No. 2 is listed as the most difficult, but the next two most difficult rated holes also await you on the front nine. If you can survive the front, the back nine features a few short par 4s and two par 3s that require no more than a wedge or 9 iron.Getting there : From I-37 south take I-77 south and exit FM 624.

The undulating, tree-lined fairways were designed to mimic a hilly New England course but the moss-covered cypresses, palm trees, and marshy swamplands are true to the Florida landscape. The layout features tight fairways framed with contoured mounding and the occasional water hazard but the most formidable challenge comes from the bunkers strategically placed along the undulating greens.

Six of the par 4s play over 400 yards and a few par 3s measure over 200 yards, which also helps the course feel longer. Water hazards and bunkers come into play but they are balanced by large greens and wide fairways that make for easier approaches. Although beginners won't feel out of place and there are four different sets of tees, the golf course boasts several tricky holes that will challenge even the best players. One of these, the 163-yard 13th, was once called the best par 3 in Tampa Bay.",https://www.linksoflakebernadette.com/,,,,,,

In addition, more than 10,000 railroad ties were used to create another classic Dye design.

12947,North Shore Country Club,"North Shore Country Club sits along the Intracoastal Waterway, offering holes that play along the ocean as well as some that play inland weaving through coastal marshes and towering pines. The golf course blends seamlessly with the scenic surroundings. Strategically placed bunkers fiercely protect the greens and golfers should also be prepared for some tricky forced carries. The fairways are generous and forgiving though. The course is a fair test but it is especially tough on windy days. The interior, tree-lined holes contrast nicely with the waterfront holes and they have the added benefit of protection from the prevailing sea breezes. North Shore Country Club is a player-friendly layout that both beginners and seasoned players can enjoy, which is why it has become one of the Outer Banks' most popular golfing destinations.",https://www.northshoregolfcoursenc.com/,,,,,,

When we originally called to schedule a round that we ended up avoiding, we were abruptly told by the older gentleman who answered the phone that the course wasn’t open to the public.

13005,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

The resulting layout blends in almost seamlessly with the natural landscape. The golf course is routed through forests of mature oak trees and around five sparkling lakes. The back nine plays along a meandering creek. Water hazards come into play on a total of 13 holes and there are nearly 50 bunkers strategically placed throughout. The golf course demands a fair amount of accuracy but it's not overly punishing if you're errant. The final hole plays from an elevated tee, requiring a carry over the creek in order to reach the green. In addition to the golf course, Oak Ridge also offers a practice facility with a driving range, two practice greens, and a practice bunker.",https://www.senicasoakridge.net/,,,,,,

Pete Dye and his son P.B. collaborated to design the course, making it the only Dye design in the Chicago area. A well thought-out strategy will be greatly rewarded on this challenging layout and bad shots made without any thought will be severely punished. This is definitely not a golf course where you can just grip it and rip it. The fairways are fairly straight and forgiving, but most of the approach shots play to tricky elevated greens. There are also strategically placed bunkers framing the greens and water hazards come into play on several holes as well. Ruffled Feathers Golf Club's par 3s have a reputation for being particularly challenging.

At just over 6,300 yards, the golf course is not particularly lengthy but it still offers some formidable challenges. Water is a prominent feature of the course with ponds and a winding river coming into play on 12 holes. The greens are small and raised and the sculpted fairways are tightly lined with mature trees, demanding accuracy off the tee. Crane's Landing Golf Club's back nine is especially difficult thanks to the river, which runs along the entire left side of the 13th hole and also appears on no. 17, the course's longest hole.",https://www.craneslandinggolf.com/,,,,,,

Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.oakhillscc.com/,,,,,,

The newer front nine has a link-style design that demands accuracy off the tee with 29 sand traps strategically placed throughout the nine holes. There are a variety of other hazards as well.

The par-72 course that exists today tumbles across a variety of elevation changes that range from subtle to dramatic. The golf course is mostly wide open, putting it at the mercy of the prevailing winds. On particularly blustery days, Crystal Woods Golf Club is quite demanding.

The golf course has a classic design that stretches to just over 6,000 yards from the back tees. Though the holes may seem short by modern standards, you'll soon find out that they require thought and will test your shot-making skills. Water comes into play in the form of a long, meandering creek that traverses the length of the course. It feeds into a large lake that comes into play on the 12th and 13th holes.

In addition, more than 10,000 railroad ties were used to create another classic Dye design.

The layout features ample greens that come in a variety of shapes, providing unique challenges throughout. The fairways are generous but they still demand a fair amount of accuracy since they are flanked by out-of-bounds areas. Water comes into play on only two holes. The golf course can be very demanding at times, specifically on the fourth hole. This par 4 is wooded from tee to green on both sides and requires a tee shot over a narrow creek before turning up a steep hill to a dramatically undulating green. Hickory Hills Golf Club also offers several warm-up options including a driving range with six target greens and a short game facility with a putting green and practice bunkers.",https://www.hickoryhills.com/,,,,,,

13559,Bass Lake Golf Course,"Bass Lake Golf Course boasts some of the finest golf in the Northwoods. Carefully carved from mature forests of oak and pine trees, the course is abundant with native wildlife. The course dates back to 1926 but it underwent a major renovation in 2003 that made certain aspects more challenging, while also making it more playable for a wider range of skill levels. The layout is much like playing two golf courses in one with a front nine that is tightly lined with trees and a hillier back nine that wraps around a large lake. There are also a few small ponds that come into play on the front nine. The rolling terrain guarantees uneven lies as well as the occasional blind shot. Accuracy will also be needed in order to avoid the strategically placed sand traps, mature trees, and thick rough.",https://golfbasslake.com/,,,,,,

The golf course features tight fairways lined with mature trees, tricky doglegs, and multi-tiered greens that can be difficult to read. The rolling terrain also promises difficult uphill and downhill lies. Bunkers are strategically placed throughout and there is water on a few holes. A windy day adds yet another formidable element to the challenging design. The diverse layout has a mix of difficult par 3s, reachable par 5s, and a few birdie opportunities.

Oak Hurst is also well known for its large, well-bunkered, undulating greens and water that comes into play on over half of the holes.The number-one-rated hole is No. 10, a challenging 595-yard par 5 that welcomes golfers who’ve allowed their concentration to wane at the turn.

13756,Bent Tree Golf Club,"The lush, rolling terrain occupied by Bent Tree Golf Club was sculpted into one of the most popular championship golf courses in central Ohio. Dennis Griffiths, the course's architect, seamlessly blended the design with the natural features of the landscape. The abundant natural water hazards come into play on half the holes and Griffiths strategically incorporated several well placed bunkers. The terrain's gentle undulations provide some interesting slope in the greens that place a priority on accuracy. Bent Tree Golf Club's par-4 eighth hole is especially demanding. It may be short at only 334 yards but it is surrounded by bunkers on all sides. It is followed by another tricky par 4 that requires both distance and accuracy in order to navigate the tree-lined fairway uphill to an undulating green faced with bunkers to the front and back.",https://www.benttreegc.com/,,,,,,
13761,Wolf Run Golf Club,"Wolf Run Golf Club is one of south Reno's most popular courses. The course is situated amid the Sierra Foothills, tumbling across a picturesque desert landscape sprinkled with native flora. The layout has many risk-reward opportunities and the par-3 holes are especially fun. The hilly terrain is as scenic as it is challenging, providing some tricky uneven lies and there is a meandering creek that slithers along the fairways. Though it's wide open, the golf course requires a bit of accuracy and some good course management. The elevated tees offer some spectacular views as well as some intimidating approaches to the fast, undulating greens. In addition to the golf course, Wolf Run also has a practice facility with a driving range and putting and chipping greens.

Pro golfers such as Tommy Bolt, Charles Coody, Don Cherry, Mike Standly, and Bob Estes have all spent time here.The fairways are generous and the layout is loaded with bunkers. The track’s first hole of note is the beautiful 360-yard par 4 No. 5, which doglegs left. Locals aim at the three oaks on the right side of the fairway and work their draw. The most difficult hole is the 390-yard par 4 ninth hole, which plays uphill into the wind with an approach that must carry water. Hole 14 (190 yards) is also tough, requiring a long iron with the wind–which makes it impossible at times to hold the green, and is especially treacherous with water front and left of the green.Getting there : From I-20 west, exit 83/84 and take the Buffalo Gap exit. Turn left onto Industrial, then turn right when you come to Treadway. The course is on the right side of the street.",https://www.abilenecountryclub.com/,,,,,,

14086,Bent Tree Golf Club,"The lush, rolling terrain occupied by Bent Tree Golf Club was sculpted into one of the most popular championship golf courses in central Ohio. Dennis Griffiths, the course's architect, seamlessly blended the design with the natural features of the landscape. The abundant natural water hazards come into play on half the holes and Griffiths strategically incorporated several well placed bunkers. The terrain's gentle undulations provide some interesting slope in the greens that place a priority on accuracy. Bent Tree Golf Club's par-4 eighth hole is especially demanding. It may be short at only 334 yards but it is surrounded by bunkers on all sides. It is followed by another tricky par 4 that requires both distance and accuracy in order to navigate the tree-lined fairway uphill to an undulating green faced with bunkers to the front and back.",https://www.benttreegc.com/,,,,,,

14099,Denison Country Club,"Denison Country Club is a basic 18-hole track that features only one par 4 over 400 yards. The fairways are of standard width and are lined by mature trees, but what you’ll remember after your round are the extremely small greens. If you can nail the approach shots, it’s pretty much birdies galore here because the course is short and doesn’t offer up too many hazards.On the front, the most difficult hole is the long par 5 No. 9, which plays 572 yards from the back. The back nine, like the front, is loaded with short par 3s that play from 300 to 350 yards.Getting there : From Hwy. 75, take Hwy. 84 west to the course.",https://www.denisongolfandcountryclub.com/lander,,,,,,

14329,Meadowbrook Country Club,"Meadowbrook Country Club in Racine is just a short drive from Milwaukee and Kenosha as well as northeastern Illinois. The golf course is interwoven with a meandering creek that is connected to three ponds, all of which come into play on several holes throughout the course. The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings. Meadowbrook C.C. has hosted several events over the years, including numerous Wisconsin state opens.",https://www.meadowbrookracine.com/?utm_source=redirect&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=mccdicarlo%20redirect,,,,,,

14371,Buffalo Creek Golf Club,"Highly touted Buffalo Creek has been praised for its layout, condition, and overall attention to detail. No matter who you talk to in the DFW area, they all seem to praise the superb condition of the course from tee to green. Offering a 7,078-yard par 71 Jay Morrish/Tom Weiskopf design, Buffalo Creek offers a good combination of holes: straight holes, dogleggers, uphill and downhill shots, and both long and short holes.One of the best features is the club’s method of using a pin location sheet to mark exactly where each pin is located on a particular day (up to six locations), which is unbelievably helpful to hacks who’ve never played the course before and have no feel for the look and contour of the greens.Getting there : Take I-30 east from Dallas and exit Ridge Rd.

The golf course also enjoys panoramic views of the Sacramento Valley. Massive rock outcroppings border the fairways, calling for some creative shot making. Accuracy is also a necessity with meandering creeks and bunkers coming into play on most holes. The layout is challenging but five sets of tees make the golf course approachable for a variety of skill levels.

They persevered with their idea and eventually established an 18-hole, par-72 course right in Cumberland Center. The golf course has a traditional layout that is heavily lined with trees. Accuracy is an important part of the round but if you can manage to hit straight, you'll have a good game. Strategically placed bunkers also lurk along the greensides and fairways. In addition to the golf course, there is a driving range and practice green. Val Halla Golf & Recreation Center is a scenic and more affordable alternative to other options in Portland.",https://www.cumberlandmaine.com/,,,,,,

14706,Hillcrest Golf Club,"Alvin's second country club opened in the 1960s, built by a man named Shorty Plaster who wanted to make the most of his land investment. Shorty was a hacker and his short course is designed to accommodate the lesser golfer with its executive-like 2,385-yard length.Plaster's design opens up with three par 3s, followed by another on No. 5. Every par 4 plays 350 yards or less, and the sole par 5 is only 475 yards. Not many non-par-3 9-holers are blessed with lights, but this one is. The same goes for the driving range, so you can definitely spend some hours at this nice little country course.Getting there : From I-45 south, exit Dixie Farm Rd. and turn right. Drive 8 miles to where it dead-ends, then turn on Hwy 35. Drive 8 miles to Fairway Dr. and turn left.",https://www.hillcrestnightgolf.com/,,,,,,

The gentle start offered by the front nine is nicely balanced with the more challenging back nine. Be sure to build up your score on the player-friendly first half because greater accuracy will be required for the final stretch of the golf course. With plenty of variety among all of the holes, the layout will test your skill with different types of shots. There are a variety of elevation changes ranging from subtle to dramatic, providing tricky uphill and downhill lies. The contours are complemented by strategically placed bunkers that lurk along the challenging greens.

Nestled in the rolling hills of central Main, the golf course runs alongside the river that created its namesake valley. The scenic landscape is covered with mature trees, which are concentrated along the undulating fairways. The original design was slightly tweaked in 2001 to make it both more challenging and more playable. The green sizes were reduced and bunkers were shifted or removed. The result was a golf course that is challenging enough for more advanced players but still gentle enough for beginners to approach with confidence. The classic elements of Ross' design still manage to shine though, which has cemented Penobscot Valley Country Club's status as a Maine tradition.",https://penobscotvalleycc.com/,,,,,,

Having two different designers gives the golf course plenty of variety, especially since the holes are intermingles. Cornish's greens are bigger and flatter while the Ross holes feature some of his characteristic greens and bunkers. Water hazards come into play as well and you'll face a few tricky doglegs and blind shots. There are some challenging holes but overall it's not an overly difficult golf course. The average player can still approach it with confidence. With a secluded location in rural western Massachusetts, Ellinwood Country Club offers beautiful views of the surrounding countryside. The 11th hole, with a winding brook that runs alongside the fairway before cutting in front of the green, is particularly scenic.",https://www.ellinwoodgolf.com/,,,,,,

14907,Marshfield Country Club,"Opened in 1923, Marshfield Country Club was one of the first golf courses in the area. There have been many changes over the years, including opening to the public in 1965 and the addition of another nine holes in 1974. At just over 6,000 yards, it's a short course by modern standards but it's no pushover. The greens are known for being challenging and they are also some of the truest and smoothest putting surfaces you'll find in the area. Though length may not be required, accuracy and course management are essential. The hazards at Marshfield C.C. are mostly provided by the existing landscape, including the meandering creeks, mature trees, and rocky outcroppings, which are complemented by several strategically placed bunkers. Each hole offers a different test, beginning with a tough par 4. This dogleg left hole has a stream that cuts right through the center.",http://www.golfmarshfieldcountryclub.com/,,,,,,

The club underwent yet another multi-million dollar renovation in 2012 when the club changed ownership. In the most recent renovation, hundreds of extraneous trees were cleared from the fairways in order to get it back into pristine condition. Although it's a seemingly short layout at just over 6,200 yards from the back tees, it actually plays much longer. The first two holes are laid across the hilliest portion of the terrain. Though you have a challenging start, the rest of the Bay Pointe golf course eases into a gentler landscape.",https://baypointeclub.com/,,,,,,

There are five sets of tees on the golf course, allowing golfers to play to their own abilities.

More than 60 bunkers are strategically placed throughout the golf course and water hazards come into play on several holes. The eighth and 17th holes are challenging twin par 3s that share a large lake. They present golfers with the decision to either go for the green or play it safe, but the latter will be met with a much trickier shot if you want to make par.

The greens are severely sloped and they play lightning fast. More often than not, you'll find that they're flanked by strategically placed bunkers as well. There are also water hazards that come into play on several holes. The golf course appeals to a wide range of skill levels since it's not overly punishing for high handicappers and there are risk-reward opportunities for more advanced players.

The ender is tough as well, featuring trees along the left, the river on the right, and that pesky creek that fronts the green.Other notes: A tenth hole was added after the river temporarily swallowed No. 8.

The golf course is also well bunkered, but there are only rare occasions where you'll have to carry a bunker in order to reach the green, and it is quite forgiving even if your shots are short. The terrain is mostly flat, making it a pleasant golf course to walk.

The golf course is not as seemingly easy as one would think since the open landscape is also subject to strong winds. There are also stands of mature trees throughout as well as waste areas that are waiting to swallow up errant shots. It is not a formidable test by any means but it is not a simple pitch-and-putt either. Players of all skill levels can get some good practice in at Riegelwood Country Club.",,,,,,,

The three nines are called the Green, Red, and Blue, and they are played in different 18-hole combinations. The Green/Red Course starts with the newest and most challenging of the three nines. The course will test you with plenty of trees, water hazards, undulating slopes, and even the occasional blind shot. There are some tough holes but players of all skill levels could enjoy any of the nines.Previously known as Green/Red at Fort Lewis Golf Course.",http://https//jblm.armymwr.com/programs/eagles-pride-golf-course/,,,,,,

Gary Panks, the golf course's designer, saw the potential of the landscape and utilized the many natural hazards. He also incorporated subtle mounding and strategically placed bunkers that blend seamlessly into the natural terrain. Panks created a fair challenge with this layout but the wide, player-friendly landing areas makes the golf course approachable for beginners. The second hole is one of the most scenic holes on the course but it is also one of the layout's more difficult holes.

The result was nothing less than spectacular as bunkers and greens were to returned original specifications with modern turf and drainage technology.

The course is located on the Novell/Word Perfect campus which explains why there is an executive course in addition to the regular 18 hole course.One word describes the hazards at Timpanogos -- water. Water comes into play on almost every hole and there are several forced carries. This can be one of the most challenging (and frustrating) courses in the area if you're not hitting the ball straight. It's possible to empty your ball bag on this course on a bad day.Favorite holes are number 4 and number 10 (now some other number because the back nine was reordered during 1997). Number 4 is a par 4 which requires a blind tee shot over a marsh. Too short or left and you're dead in the marsh, too far right and you're either wet or are faced with a long second shot. Number 10 (maybe 12 now) is a par five that offers several ways to attack, all of them dangerous. If you go for the green in 2 you have to carry the entire length of a pond. To lay up you have to hit a narrow fairway and risk going too far through and out of bounds.",https://www.timpanogosgolf.com/,,,,,,

Hills took advantage of not only the beautiful views afforded by the course's location right along the Assawomen Bay, but also the natural diversity of the terrain. He routed the front nine along the bay while the back nine borders the St. Martin's River, through mature hardwoods and pristine marshland. The golf course is home to the longest cart bridge in the country, stretching almost 1,500 feet to bring golfers from the bay-side holes to the marshland holes. It is also the only course in the U.S. with five consecutive holes playing to the same double green. The signature hole is the par-3 fifth, which requires a carry over a marsh to a nearly island green bordered by water on three sides.",https://lighthousesound.com/,,,,,,

The front nine is wide open with some room for error but the back nine is routed through woodlands, demanding accuracy and thoughtful strategy.

Thankfully, this monster is void of hazards. On the back No. 13 is feast or famine–a short par 5 at 483 yards, but a pond sits in the middle of the fairway.

At just over 6,000 yards, it's a short course by modern standards but it's no pushover. The greens are known for being challenging and they are also some of the truest and smoothest putting surfaces you'll find in the area. Though length may not be required, accuracy and course management are essential. The hazards at Marshfield C.C. are mostly provided by the existing landscape, including the meandering creeks, mature trees, and rocky outcroppings, which are complemented by several strategically placed bunkers.

Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.oakhillscc.com/,,,,,,

16445,Colonial Country Club,"Colonial Country Club, located in Fort Worth on the southern banks of the Trinity River and near TCU, is one of the most historic golf clubs in Texas. The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times. Other multiple winners of this longstanding PGA Tour event include Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Nick Price and Ben Crenshaw.",https://www.colonialgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

16672,Oak Hills Country Club,"""Oak Hills is classic golf architecture at its finest,"" says Carl Bielstein, La Cantera's director of golf, about Oak Hills Country Club's heritage and its noted architect, A.W. Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.oakhillscc.com/,,,,,,

It was the club's original layout before it was joined by the Desert Course a year later.

The layout is challenging but playable with elevation changes and strategically placed bunkers that are balanced by large greens and wide, player-friendly fairways. One of the golf course's most memorable holes is the par-5 second. This challenging 530-yard hole plays around a massive lake but with an accurate second shot, it is reachable in two.

16841,Brigantine Golf Links,"The public, 18-hole golf course at Brigantine Golf Links is not only beautiful scenery and a great game it is also a National Audubon Sanctuary. Its layout has roots in Scottish golfing tradition. The golf course utilizes the natural environment featuring a softly rolling terrain and marshes as well as gorgeous bay views.Like traditional Scottish Links courses, Brigantine is marked by nearly tree-less greens and the type of shot to take often depends on the wind. There are powerful sea breezes that affect the shots and bunkers that make for an interesting game. The smooth, rolling greens encourage a bump-and-run strategy. The scenic course's location close to the Atlantic City boardwalk and the challenging, but fun game it offers make it popular among tourists and locals of all skill levels.",https://www.brigantinegolf.com/,,,,,,

The club has roots that date back to the 1800s when it was known as Cape May Country Club. The peacefully secluded golf course is nestled amidst mature woodlands, surrounding one of the largest private bird sanctuaries in New Jersey. The scenery is beautiful but don't let that distract you. There are plenty of challenges to keep you on your toes, including tree-lined fairways, strategically placed bunkers, and several water hazards. There are a few blind shots that make Cape May National Golf Club especially tricky if playing it for the first time. The classic design is a fair test but it's player-friendly enough for a wide range of skill levels.",https://www.cmngc.com/,,,,,,

The layout is routed through freshwater lagoons and marshes, which means you'll be facing water on several holes. Rolling dunes provide subtle but challenging contours throughout the course as well. The terrain is tough enough but there are also the ever-present winds to contend with. For some scenic respite from this formidable test, scenic views of the Atlantic can be enjoyed on almost every hole.

Undulating breaks make them difficult to read at times. The layout starts with a relatively open front nine where bunkered greens are the most prominent challenges. The back nine is longer and there are more trees and penalty ditches. The 16th hole is one of the most challenging on the golf course with a plateau green that sits four feet above the fairway and flanked with bunkers. The title of most difficult hole though, goes to Benvenue Country Club's fourth hole.

17221,Colonial Country Club,"Colonial Country Club, located in Fort Worth on the southern banks of the Trinity River and near TCU, is one of the most historic golf clubs in Texas. The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times. Other multiple winners of this longstanding PGA Tour event include Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Nick Price and Ben Crenshaw.",https://www.colonialgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

The golf course starts out gentle enough but by the time you get to the third hole, you'll be tested with a hole that plays right into the prevailing wind. This long narrow par 4 is one of the toughest holes Emerald Lake Golf Club has to offer. You'll get a brief break with the fourth hole, but the following par 5 is the signature hole.

17609,Carolina Lakes Golf Course,"Carolina Lakes is the golf course at Shaw Air Force Base near Sumter. It is a military course that is not open to the public. In terms of military courses, this layout stands out for not being a typical pitch-and-putt. The golf course is just under 6,500 yards from the back tees, offering a good mix of length with some shorter holes. With water hazards coming into play on several holes as well as a good number of strategically placed bunkers, it is a course that will make you think. There are also a variety of elevation changes that are seemingly subtle but can cause more problems than you think. One particularly memorable hole is the first par 3 you reach on the front nine, which requires a forced carry over a pond.",https://www.thebestfss.com/recreation/carolina-lakes-golf-course,,,,,,

Don’t let the 6,485 yards on the scorecard fool you, the daunting elevation changes make the course feel much longer. Walkers should be forewarned that this mountainous golf course is nearly impossible on foot. You can expect a few approaches to uphill greens but more often you’ll be faced with intimidating shots from elevated tees, which loom more than 200 feet above the severely contoured fairways below.

The front nine is gentler than the back, where the par 3s present formidable tests. The water hazards on the back are particularly challenging. The golf course finishes with one of its most memorable holes. Ravenwood's par-5 18th has a green that's tucked into the woods with the hill behind it forming a natural amphitheater.

The golf club bought the old Nashville Golf and Country Club's clubhouse and land for $22,500, leased an additional 92 acres on which to build an 18-hole golf course and enlisted the golf course architect Donald Ross to lay it all out.Of course, golfers at the Richland Country Club today are playing an all-new golf course in an all-new spot, this one a Jack Nicklaus Signature Golf Course that runs alongside the Granny White Park.After a round at the Richland Country Club, head back to the clubhouse and the Waxo Greene Grille for casual eats and sweet vistas of the golf course, not to mention a round around the fireplace.",https://www.richlandcc.com/,,,,,,

17900,Abernathy Country Club,"Like so many other small-town courses in the Panhandle, this “country club” is a 9-hole, semi-private course that allows anyone to play. With only one water hazard (hole 9), no bunkers, and flat terrain, this course is very fair, good for the ego, and fun for the high handicapper. This course is best experienced as a day trip from Lubbock.The fairways are lined with trees and sport rare mounds that result in an uneven lie. Both par 5s have dogleg fairways. The toughest hole is a 226-yard, par 3 into a green framed by mature trees; it’s particularly difficult when the winds are howling. Pay once and play all day. For the second round use the additional set of tees for a different look.Getting there : Exit FM 2060 off of I-27 and head east 4.5 miles to the course.",,,,,,,
17901,Abilene Country Club,"The par-70 Club Course at Abilene Country Club dates back to 1920, but was redesigned in 1993 by George Williams and Garrett Gill, who reconstructed 10 holes. Pro golfers such as Tommy Bolt, Charles Coody, Don Cherry, Mike Standly, and Bob Estes have all spent time here.The fairways are generous and the layout is loaded with bunkers. The track’s first hole of note is the beautiful 360-yard par 4 No. 5, which doglegs left. Locals aim at the three oaks on the right side of the fairway and work their draw. The most difficult hole is the 390-yard par 4 ninth hole, which plays uphill into the wind with an approach that must carry water. Hole 14 (190 yards) is also tough, requiring a long iron with the wind–which makes it impossible at times to hold the green, and is especially treacherous with water front and left of the green.Getting there : From I-20 west, exit 83/84 and take the Buffalo Gap exit. Turn left onto Industrial, then turn right when you come to Treadway. The course is on the right side of the street.",https://www.abilenecountryclub.com/,,,,,,

William McConnell designed the course way back in 1919, and renovations occurred in 1960 (Warren Cantrell), and again in 1983 (Jay Morrish).Tree-lined fairways, various hills, and several out-of-bounds make this a tough course, even though it’s relatively short and there are minimal water hazards. The course has a good variety of holes, with several par 4s over 400 yards and only three par 5s. The feature hole is No. 6, a 349-yard par 4 that requires an approach shot over a lake into a green surrounded by bunkers.Getting there : North of town on I-40 going west, take the Western Ave. exit and turn left.

Its back nine is the favorite-a challenging, tighter track with a better set of holes. The best hole is No. 15, a long, 430-yarder that involves water off the tee and a creek that impacts the approach on the left.Getting there : From Houston, take I-45 north to Hwy. 105. Drive west 9 miles to the course on the right.",https://www.invitedclubs.com/clubs/april-sound-country-club,,,,,,
17916,Archer City Country Club,"Defining the outskirts of town, with ranchland beyond the mesquite-lined fairways, this 9-hole, semi-private course has unquestionable character. Rusted iron ladders have been placed on the barbed-wire fences surrounding the course, enabling one to track down shots that somehow don’t find the fairway. The asphalt cart paths are cracked, the tee boxes are baked hard, and the bald Bermuda fairways shine like a bowling alley from the abuse of the sun and wind, enabling even the most incapable golfer to reach a par 5 in two.The track features medium-length par 4s and a small lake that comes into play on a few holes. There are a few elevation changes, but the course is mostly flat. The greens are simple to read, a bit quick, and in good condition. Best of all, the price is right and the people are friendly.Getting there : From Wichita Falls, take Texas 79 south to Archer City.

The front nine allows more room for wild tee shots, as it’s more wide-open than the back. The feature hole is No. 13, a 427-yard par 4 highlighted by a blind approach shot to the green.Getting there : From I-20 drive east and take Hwy 19 south.

17922,Austin Country Club,"Back around 1900, when the greater Austin area was only home to about 25,000 residents, Harvard Law School graduate and lifetime Austinite Lewis Hancock organized one of Texas’ first formal country clubs, the venerable Austin Country Club.The first nine-hole course, now known as Hancock Park, featured sand greens and a tiny two-room framed clubhouse. The club stayed put for half a century, noted for the presence of Harvey Penick. Then after a huge local debate, the facility was moved to Riverside Drive in East Austin. From there it made it another 35 years before moving to its current Davenport Ranch location.The current ACC layout, designed by Pete Dye, rests on the shores of Lake Austin and the Colorado River. Dye didn’t veer from his usual method of creating an impressively difficult track using his trademark railroad ties, deep pot bunkers, and huge undulations.The opening holes play along Lake Austin, and are more of a links-style design. Afterwards the Hill Country takes effect, featuring canyons, ravines, creeks, and unbelievable views.The back nine features many outstanding holes, including the 446-yard No. 11, which deceptively doglegs left along a canyon before requiring an approach over that same deep ravine.

The course, which opened in 2001, has slipped under the publicity radar and is an exclusive, quiet club that simply serves as a place to play for its members.While not much information is available for the course, AGC is unique because of its outstanding caddie program, and because it’s one of the only courses in the area with Zoysia tees, fairways, and first cut of rough. Perhaps we’ll be able work our way on in the future, but for now we can only drool over the lush bent-greens that Master Crenshaw created.Getting there : We’re not exactly sure because the location is somewhat secret, but you could take Texas 71 west out of Austin for about 20 miles, then tour the back roads around Spicewood toward the lake looking for an ocean of green, lush Zoysia grass.",,,,,,,
17925,Balcones Country Club -Balcones,"Originally located in a remote part of the Hill Country that has now been absorbed by the Austin city limits, the BCC dates back to 1956 when it was only a 9-hole layout. Today the club boasts two totally distinct tracks, known as the Balcones Course and the Spicewood Course.The original 9-holer transformed into the easier Balcones Course. With water on only two holes (15 and 16), it’s just a friendlier layout that is enjoyable also because it plays fast. The signature hole is No. 6, a 456-yard par 4 highlighted by a magnificent old oak tree in the fairway.Getting there : From I-35 north, take Highway 183 north and take a right on Hunter's Chase Road. Turn left, drive a little ways, and the course is on your left.",https://balconescountryclub.com/,,,,,,
17926,Ballinger Country Club,"This 9-hole, semi-private course (open to out-of-towners) features a small creek and mildly undulating terrain. The creek impacts two holes, and there is only one hole with bunkers. No. 2 is the signature hole, a 379-yard par 4 with a tee shot over a canyon and out-of-bounds on either side of the fairway. Nothing too fancy here–both par 3s are well under 200 yards. The first hole is a 268-yard par 4, and No. 3 is listed as a par 5 at 426 yards.Getting there : From the courthouse in town, turn left on Hwy 158. Follow the road as it veers left over a hill. You’ll see a nursing home hospital, and then eventually a green sign on the left for the city lake and country club.

Environmentally friendly like the other three tracks, this one was designated in the Certified Audubon Sanctuary System (one of the first in the country), which speaks to the level of care that went into preserving the natural environment.At Fazio’s disposal was the Short Springs Branch Creek, a scenic limestone bedded feature that rolls through the course, and enhances the oak and sycamore laden fairways. The views on this one are just as tremendous as the others, and the golf community has already heaped heavy praise for the Canyons, with Golfweek Magazine labeling it the #1 Course in Texas for 2002.The ender is the signature, a 561-yarder that might be the best finishing hole at Barton Creek. The most difficult hole finishes off the front side, a 457-yard par 4.",https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/austin-barton-creek,,,,,,
17932,Bay City Country Club,"Bay City's original course dates back to the 1930s-it lays out along the Colorado River with giant old oak trees lining the fairways. In addition to the river, another creek winds through the layout, keeping water in play on just about every hole.No. 6 is considered the signature not only for the stunning view of the countryside, but for its 185-yard poke over the water. The ender is tough as well, featuring trees along the left, the river on the right, and that pesky creek that fronts the green.Other notes: A tenth hole was added after the river temporarily swallowed No. 8. Walking is only allowed during the week.Getting there : From Hwy. 35, turn left on Latuelley, and the course is about a mile away.",https://www.facebook.com/baycity.countryclub.3,,,,,,

Another short par 4 and two par 3s follow, allowing the day to start right. Later on the front, the number one handicap 8th hole shows up, playing 520 yards and generally not reachable in two.The back nine consists of short par 4s and 3s and offers plenty of birdie opportunities.Getting there : From I-10 east, take Hwy. 69 north to Lucas, then drive east to Pine St. Turn left and the course is a short distance down the road.",https://www.beaumontcountryclub.com/,,,,,,

17946,Bellville Golf & Recreation Club,"Bellville offers a decent little 9-hole country course with wide-open fairways and small, mound-shaped greens that can be extremely tricky at times, depending on the condition. As with many small-town courses, the funds just are not available to maintain the course up to championship standards, so conditions vary depending on the weather. The trick here is to get used to the target greens and deal with the conditions-otherwise you might miss a few make-able putts. But we do that under the best of conditions, so does it really matter?One pond comes into play on holes 6 and 7. Despite the greens, the tee boxes and fairways are generally in good condition.Getting there : From I-10 east, take Hwy. 36 north to the course about 15 miles away",https://www.bellvillegolf.com/,,,,,,

17950,Bent Tree Country Club,"Located next to Dallas’ exclusive Preston Trail Golf Club, Bent Tree opened in 1974 as the centerpiece for a 700-acre development headed by Dallas real estate investors Robert Folsom and John Murchison. The two hired the eclectic Scotsman Desmond Muirhead to design the course on 190 acres of former cotton fields.In the 1980s, the LPGA and Senior PGA tours frequently hosted tournaments at Bent Tree, and the course was eventually renovated in 1990. The improvements focused on the front nine (which is still more open than the back), spicing up the layout with bunkering, tree additions, and adjustments to greens.Water comes into play on 14 of 18 holes, and the course is quite long if you play from the tips. The best hole on the front is No. 3, a long par 5 that plays almost 600 yards. The narrow fairway chutes between water on the left and bunkers on the right, and the small green slopes severely to the water on the left side.The more interesting back nine offers a nice stretch of golf on holes 13-15. No. 14 is the most scenic on the course because it plays downhill at least 75 feet to a green surrounded on three sides by water. The 387-yard 18th is the perfect finishing hole–not too long but plenty challenging.Getting there : From I-635 east, take the Dallas North Tollway and exit Westgrove. The course is on the left.",https://www.benttreecc.org/,,,,,,
17951,Bentwater Yacht & Country Club -Miller,"The Miller Course is quite different from Weiskopf's design. Architect Jack Miller, who worked as a designer under Jack Nicklaus for 10 years, bragged that the terrain ""is absolutely the finest piece of land I've ever been able to work on."" His parkland-style track features lush fairways, virtually no rough, pine needles sprinkled about the course, and Champion Bermuda greens that are surrounded by huge swales.No. 14 is bordered by the blue waters of Lake Conroe, and is annually selected as one of the best par 3s in Texas",https://www.bentwater.com/,,,,,,
17952,Bentwood Country Club,"Bentwood opened in 1979 and is an 18-hole private course laid out through a residential community. The course can be difficult when the wind is blowing, especially with its somewhat lengthy layout (almost 7,000 yards from the tips) and out-of-bounds on most holes. Four sets of tees provide options for every skill level. The fairways and roughs consist of the durable 419 Bermuda grass, and the large, undulating greens are Champion Dwarf Bermuda.The front nine gives you the chance to start well with several par 4s under 400 hundred yards, and a 523 yard par 5 that is a definite birdie opportunity when the wind is at your back.The feature hole is No. 8, which has out-of-bounds on the right and usually plays into the prevailing south wind. At 464 yards it plays more like a par 5, and starts a difficult stretch of golf that extends through the 13th hole. Holes 9 and 10 play just over 400 yards, with the latter a dogleg left with water on the right and out-of-bounds on the left. The approach on No. 10 is into an elevated green surrounded by bunkers. Eleven is a 517-yard par 5, followed by a monster par 3 (224 yards), and another relatively long par 4 No. 13 (420 yards).Getting there : Located on the southwest side of town off Loop 306.

Water is in play on 10 holes, including the tricky 326-yard 9th, where the tee shot needs to clear the first lake and the approach must carry another.The par 3 No. 12 is another beautiful hole. Your tee shot must slide through a narrow chute of trees and avoid the lake to the left of the skinny green.Getting there : From I-35 north, take Exit 266 and turn left.

There are no bunkers or water hazards. The course weaves in and out of a quaint housing community, and a few elevated tees offer views of Lake LBJ.Notable holes include the 365-yard par 4 with out-of-bounds looming left and trees on the right, and the par 3 16th, which plays almost 200 yards.Two sets of tees make for an 18-hole round, andyou can pay once and play all day.Getting there : From Hwy. 71 west, turn right on Blue Lake Deer Haven Dr., then drive 2 miles north to the course.",https://bluelakegolf.com/,,,,,,

The short course, void of bunkers, opens up with a nice, short par 3 that only requires a 9 iron at most. The remainder of the layout features short par 4s, and a series of back-to-back par 5s and par 3s on holes 4-8.The toughest hole, which is the longest par 4, is the 395-yard No. 3, but it’s followed by a 278-yard par 4.Two sets of tees allow for an 18-hole round.Getting there : From Loop 121 north, turn right on Russell Ave. From Hwy.78, turn left on Russell Ave.",,,,,,,
17966,Booker Country Club,"Unique in that it is the northernmost course in Texas, BCC is a nice little layout with a few trees lining wide fairways.

The greens are small, of average speed, and putt true.This 3,054-yard par 35 does not require length, but accuracy is important because of the overhanging trees. Water impacts play on two of the final three holes, and while the course starts out fairly wide open, you’ll soon learn to be aware of the impact of the trees.Getting there : From I-35, take Hwy. 22 west to Meridian.

The course features wide, tree-lined fairways and small greens, as well as water that comes into play on almost half of the holes.One local told us that short-iron play was important; however, that’s hard to imagine considering the length of some of the holes. Three holes stand out from the tips: Two par 5s play 600 yards or better (No. 11 is 643 yards), and No. 3, a 247-yard par 3.

The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas.

Fred Mcleaod, then the winter professional at Maryland's Columbia Country Club, built the course in 1909, followed by a redesign at the hands of John Bredemus in 1921 and a rare visit by Robert Trent Jones in the mid-1960s. This beautiful links-style course offers open fairways and undulating greens where stiff winds can interfere with drives and cause high shots to blow wildly off course.When the 9-hole course originally opened on the high-toned North Beach, President William Howard Taft was in Texas to visit his brother, who owned a ranch across Nueces Bay. Taft participated in the opening ceremonies in front of the green wooden building which is distinguished by its white trim and veranda on all four sides.The course fell victim to the 1919 hurricane, and club members didn't reorganize until 1921. John Bredemus came down from Del Rio after the completion of the San Felipe Springs Country Club and immediately put crewmen to work clearing and grading for $1.50 a day. The fairways and greens were fertilized with cottonseed meal, and the first shot was fired on Labor Day, 1922. At the time, this course on the Texas Riviera was considered one of the finest in the country.At the end of the Depression, oil was discovered under the course and wells produced from 1936 to 1943, increasing revenues but creating some interesting man-made hazards in the layout. By 1938, the club expanded the course to 18 holes.

18118,El Paso Country Club,"The crown jewel of golf out here is the El Paso Country Club, with its old-school charm and a burgeoning reputation as a proving ground for future PGA stars. Built along the Rio Grande River, this course is the oldest in West Texas, dating back to 1906. It has gained recent acclaim since former employee Rich Beem burst onto the scene with his victory at the 2002 PGA Championship. The colorful tales of the Friday game at EPCC paint a vivid picture of how the former cell phone salesman honed his gamesmanship and confidence to the level of a major champion.The present course was designed in 1922 by Jack Harden, then modified via a $1.5 million Ron Fream renovation. The traditional layout is not long (6,889 yards), but requires pro-like accuracy on approach shots, and the bent-grass greens feature the speed and quickness characteristic of any pro setup.No. 15 is the feature hole. It's a short par 4 that requires accuracy to avoid the fairway bunkers and trees off the tee, then a little savvy to deal with the approach shot into a super-slick green covered by more bunkers.Getting there : From I-10 west take Exit 11 and make a left turn onto Mesa.

18129,Fairway Oaks Country Club,"Originally built in the 1970s by Ron Garl and Charles Coody, the club was purchased in the late 1990s and has been updated for the more modern game. Fairway is a long, challenging course that has hosted the Southwest Classic from 1981 to 1991. The layout incorporates many bunkers, and water dominates the back nine. In 1981 the LaJet Classic at Fairway Golf and Racquet Club was added to the PGA tour.The highlight of the course is the demanding nature of the finishing holes. Many a promising round has been tossed into the water that’s present on each of the last five finishing holes. Survive the carries on 14 and 15, and deal with the par 3 hole 16 with water on the left, and your confidence will be strong enough to deal with the 448-yard par 4 17th, which requires a tee shot of at least 200 yards to reach the fairway.

Las Moras Creek meanders through the picturesque community of about 750 households, and the population swells a bit during the winter as retirees move in and take advantage of the warm weather.One of the great features of this course is that it offers the chance to play from the tips and score very well, as the back tees are just over 5,700 yards. Most of the par 4s are barely over 300 yards, making length off the tee a non-issue. Only the par 4 No. 16 at 357 yards resembles anything close to what you might see back home. Hole 12 has some length at 566 yards, and is the number one handicap hole.Plan accordingly if you're in the area, as the course is very popular with the locals and can get very crowded. Call ahead.

The Salado del Rio course is the more scenic of the two, offering spectacular views of the rustic countryside. The historic facility boasts some famous players including Sam Snead and Arnold Palmer. The layout is also more difficult than the other championship course at the club due to the presence of numerous blind shots and water hazards.

18151,Gaines County Golf Course,"After you drive through this flat, barren region of cotton and oil production, you’ll be stunned when you stumble upon this hidden Panhandle gem that played host to Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer in a 1963 exhibition. Originally built as a 9-hole course by Jim Terry in 1953, the facility was updated with another nine holes in 1991.The layout features good elevation and plenty of trees, especially considering the terrain. The most outstanding amenity is the greens, which are large, fast, and in excellent condition. Sometimes the fairways dry out and the condition is average, but that helps the ball roll and is definitely beneficial when the wind is blowing.Every par 3 requires a long iron, but the demanding par 4s are the attention-getters. Two par 4s stand out among many that are above average in difficulty for courses in this remote area. The signature hole is No. 8: it’s only 340 yards but requires an approach shot over a pond to a well-bunkered green. Hole 5 also plays tough as a 435-yard dogleg right with an approach into an elevated green. This hole is particularly long into the wind.Getting there : Drive through Seminole north on Hwy. 385 and look for the signs to the course.

18153,Galveston Country Club,"The original Galveston CC dates back to 1898 as a 9-hole track with a membership of only 30; however, the hurricane of 1900 wiped out the facility. The club moved back and forth between the island and the mainland in the early 1900s-it was once known as the Oleander Country Club around 1912 before moving back onto the beach in 1918. That location on 61st Street remained intact until 1946, when John Bredemus was asked to design the new, short, water-infested, wind-burdened layout that exists today.Ralph Plummer and Carlton Gipson had their hands in things over the years as developer George Mitchell obtained the facility's lease in exchange for promised long-term improvements.Today mature palms and oleanders line the fairways, and much like the old days, the modern version is known for precise shot-making. Solid course management is mandatory for scoring well.No. 7 is the most difficult, a 418-yarder that's lined by water on the left for the first half of the hole. Bogey is a good score when the wind is blowing. On the back side, the 180-yard No. 11 is a real treat. Virtually surrounded by water, the hole plays over the edge of the lake into a green framed by bunkers with water in the back.Getting there : From I-45 south, take the 61st St. exit, then drive to Sea Wall Blvd. Turn right and head down to 12 Mile Rd.

18157,Garden Valley Golf Resort -Dogwood,"The older Hummingbird Course, which has taken a back seat to the now-famous Dogwood Course, still offered some adequate golf even though the quality was not up to the standards of its more popular brethren. Highlighted by extreme elevation changes, the course’s signature hole was the 566-yard No. 2, which required two shots over a hill followed by a tricky approach back downhill to the green. Hummingbird course was closed recently and only the newer Dogwood course can be played.In 1992 John Sanford was blessed with some amazing terrain for the Dogwood Course addition. Cut out of the thick East Texas forest with 100-foot-plus tall pines, this course is most often compared to the famed Augusta National because of the abundant crape myrtle, Carolina jasmine, hollies, and dogwoods–not to mention the more than 1,500 azaleas that bloom beautifully in the spring.Although there are only two par 4s over 400 yards, the Dogwood is plenty difficult, playing to a 132 slope rating. Water is in play on 12 holes, the elevation changes are extremely confusing, and the bent-grass greens are lightning-fast.The regulars know that a good start is imperative because the first four holes are the easiest on the course–two short par 4s and two easy par 3s over water. You’ll need that momentum as the holes grow increasingly more difficult.The par 3 9th hole plays 212 yards with an intimidating body of water lurking left. Hole 11 features a lake to the left and behind the green. No. 13 is the most difficult, featuring a testy drive through the chute of trees off the tee and a massive lake that protects the green.Getting there : From I-20, take Hwy. 110 (Exit 548) south.

Lakes are placed throughout the design, coming into play on 13 holes, and the greens are extremely fast with sneaky undulations.

This hole doglegs right and has out-of-bounds on the left. No. 15 can get you at 395 yards, doglegging left around the lake.1950s. Warren Cantrell. 18 holes. Gold – 6,911 (72.9/127).

For now this course, which opened in the late 1970s, may have to wait a few more decades for its legend to grow. The course is certainly worthy, offering immaculate conditions paired with demanding target golf. Water is in play on 13 holes, the pine-lined fairways feature numerous elevation changes, and the greens are small targets.The best hole on the front is No. 4, about a 180-yarder all over water, but you're bound to notice the opening set of holes that feature two monster par 5s. The 583-yard No. 3 bends left around a lake and plays to a tricky little green nestled against water's edge.On the back, you'll remember the ender-an almost 600-yard tree-lined monster.

Because of the tight fairways, locals are in the habit of using irons off the tee. The feature hole is No. 7, a 400-yard par 4 with an approach shot over water.

You'll probably want to leave your camera behind because there's nothing really too picturesque about this golf course. The tees are slightly elevated and there is no water. The bent-grass greens are in unbelievable condition given the circumstances. There are two sets of tees for an 18-hole round.The No. 1 tee box sits directly in front of the clubhouse and is shaded by a large tree and a pavilion. The opening shot is over the road that leads to the clubhouse.The scene here is surreal. Ancient golf carts from the 1960s are littered with Crown Royal bottles, empty beer cans, cigarettes, haggard, well-used clubs with worn grips, and other random paraphernalia.

18356,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur.

This monster doglegs left inside a cliff that runs along the right side. Out-of-bounds is left, and a fairway bunker resides about a lob wedge from the narrow green, which is bolstered from behind by more bunkers.No. 18 is one of the more interesting finishing holes that you’ll come across, featuring two dogleg fairways, one right and one left, that both involve dealing with the creek that splits the two routes. The tee shot right is more favorable, since it is void of fairway bunkers like the ones on the left side.

Another tough hole is No. 14, a 225-yard par 3 that requires a solid shot to carry the water.Getting there : From I-27 south, exit Hunsley and go west.

18432,Pampa Country Club,"Home of the Top of Texas amateur tournament for over 50 years, many of Texas’ great players have flailed away on this course. This is an 18-hole, traditional layout with tree-lined fairways and solid greens; it has a few hills but not much water. If you live more than 50 miles away from Pampa, you do not have to be accompanied by a member to play the course.Make sure that you’re warmed up for the opening hole, a monster 597-yard par 5. The 422-yard par 4 No. 4 is the feature hole. This long par 4 doglegs left and involves an approach into an elevated green. Hole 11 is another long par 4 featuring a tight fairway that drops into a valley. No. 18 is a challenging finishing hole–441 yards into a tight, dogleg-left fairway.Getting there : From Downtown Pampa, take Duncan St.to E.

The course features narrow fairways and small greens, with a few water hazards and bunkers sprinkled throughout the design.The best birdie opportunity is No. 5, which plays to a par 4 at only 255 yards. Another confidence builder is No. 8, where you’ll need nothing more than a 9 iron. However, the finishing hole is the toughest: a 543-yard par 5.Pay once and play all day. The course has two sets of tees for an 18-hole round.Getting there : From Amarillo take Hwy. 60 east for 125 miles.

18436,Paris Golf & Country Club,"Dating all the way back to 1916, the Paris Golf and Country Club is one of the oldest courses in the state. The traditional design is considered more of a target course because of the curving nature of the fairways and the small greens, which are fast and usually in excellent condition. Because of the creeks and ponds scattered throughout the course, you’ll score higher than your normal handicap until you learn the layout.Beware of the back nine. Hole 14 is the most difficult, at 423 yards with out-of-bounds and water along the left side of the fairway and behind the green. No. 15 plays tough also, with a fairway framed by out-of-bounds on the right and water on the left, and an approach into a long, narrow green. Even if you survive those holes, No. 18 awaits, testing you with an approach over water into a green surrounded by bunkers.Getting there : From I-30 east, take Hwy. 24 north.

18443,Pecan Plantation Country Club,"Leon Howard laid this course out in 1971, and was given specific orders by developer Bob Leonard to take the environmentally sensitive route when designing the course. Cut out of a 3,000-acre former commercial pecan orchard in the floodplain of the Brazos River, Howard did his best to preserve trees and create a unique layout with good holes. His best work here is reflected in the difficult par 3s, all requiring long irons when playing from the 6,800-yard-plus tips.Getting there : From Hwy. 377 west, take Hwy. 144 south to Granbury.

18448,Pedernales Country Club,"“Willie’s Course” is officially called the Pedernales Country Club, but “Cut ‘N Putt” is also printed on the scorecard. This rugged, almost pasture-golf-like course is known for its superb greens, goes 3,330 yards, and despite its lack of formal hazards, is extremely challenging unless you’ve played it a few times.The old sand bunkers have been covered by sprawling Bermuda. The fairways are hard–sometimes solid tee shots will roll and roll until they find the Hill Country scrub that lines the fairways.Holes 4 and 7 have water. The fourth is notable because it requires a perfectly placed mid-iron into the dogleg-left fairway with water on the left, followed by an uphill approach over the drink to the green. They call the 7th hole the signature: the elevated tee offers one of the course’s best views, and you’ll have to deal with a severely sloping fairway that cuts right and requires another perfect tee shot to avoid having your ball slip off into oblivion.Suffice it to say, this is required golf for any true Texan who dabbles in the great game. It’s Willie’s course and it’s public. You can choose to play by his “cowboy-Zen” rules and save yourself a few strokes. Heck, he might even join you if he’s on the premises.Other notes: Charles Howard built the course and Willie took it over in 1979. Don’t miss the clubhouse, which is just a small building with Willie paraphernalia littering the walls.Getting there : From Austin, take Hwy. 71 west and turn right on County Road 2322.

There is mature landscaping throughout that sets its apart from younger courses. The mostly flat terrain of the course provides an enjoyable walk. The layout features bent grass greens and player-friendly fairways. There are a few water hazards that come into play as well as the occasional bunker, but overall the course is gentle enough for beginners to approach it with confidence. For more advanced players, it is excellent practice, especially for the price.

On no. 6, keep the tee shot right to avoid a blind second shot, and watch out for the tough, two-tiered green. The seventh hole plays along the Colorado, and is protected by a massive cottonwood tree on the left. On the back, make note that the highest point on the course is the 11th green. For the home stretch, make the most of the two downhill par 3s. No. 12 plays 180 yards and you'll need to leave it below the hole.

18471,Preston Trail Golf Club,"What makes this one of the best golf courses in the state? Let’s list the reasons: Location: Far north Dallas, with White Rock Creek meandering through. Layout: Stunning and traditional, with tree-lined fairways, the right amount of water and bunkering, and huge, lightning-fast bent-grass greens. Feel: Cart paths run the way they should--from greens to tees, not the other way around. And caddies are always available to promote playing the game on foot. Mystique: Memorabilia of professional tour players who are also members is tastefully distributed throughout the clubhouse, and the shrine to Mickey Mantle (a longtime member) is awe-inspiring. You’ll need serious connections to play this course, but here are some highlights.The third hole is a 591-yard par 5 with a narrow tee shot that opens to a wide landing area. The homes lining the right side of the fairway no doubt shelter some of the most jealous people in the world. The second shot begins to run down the dramatic slope that ends in a huge green in front of the creek.The next par 5, the 498 yard 6th, has a similar slope which begins in the landing area of your drive. If you really pop it and have the wind, you’ll be at the base of the hill with about 175 yards left to the large, two-tiered green. Be careful, though–it’s protected by dense woods on the left and back, and water on the front and right.The 7th hole is the number one handicap. This 422-yard par 4 dogleg right requires a perfectly faded and long tee shot to get far enough into the throat to approach. You’ll still be hitting a long iron or wood into the severely back-to-front sloped green, and good luck making the putt from above the hole.The back nine is maybe the best anywhere, but two holes stand out above the rest. The 16th is a 428-yard par 4 with a slight dogleg left. The tee shot is elevated at least 100 yards above where the green sits. A big, high draw will put you about 150 yards away from the two-tiered green, which is protected by the creek in front. They really like to put the pin on the lower tier right in front of the creek, which gives you about 20 square yards to work with. It’s a lay-up hole for all but the longest and bravest.The 422-yard dogleg-right finishing hole is almost a mirror of the 16th–it’s a long dogleg right, all uphill. The tee area is extremely narrow from the tips, and the fairway slopes to the left to make shaving the corner as hard as possible. This ends up being a 5 par for most, and the outcome of many Nassaus is changed on this hole.It’s hard to describe this course without gushing, not to mention that hearing about it just frustrates most people because they won’t have a chance to see it for themselves. But keep your eyes and ears open for friends who may be members and schmooze them as much as possible–it will surely be worth the effort.The details : 972-380-0669. 17201 Preston Trail Dr., Dallas, TX 752481965.

There are two defining characteristics on this course, the trees and the doglegs. Every hole on the front nine is a dogleg with the exception of two of the par 3s. On the back nine, the doglegs are less frequent but that is where all of the mature trees come into play. There are also more dramatic changes in elevation on the back nine.

Built circa 1950, the flat, traditional layout plays to a par 70 and has water on nine holes.Notable holes on the front include the 604-yard opening hole, and No. 6, a 444-yard par 4. The back 9 features only one par 5, which plays only 487 yards, and several par 4s that play well under 400 yards. However, those are well balanced with two mean par 3s that require long irons (or even a 3-wood) and the difficult finishing hole: a 400-yard-plus par 4.Getting there : Exit Business 80 off of I-20 and drive north on Fairgrounds Rd.

18484,Rancho Viejo Resort & Country Club -El Diablo,"When Dennis Arp sculpted the El Diablo course out of the vast citrus orchards, golf became the thing to do in Rancho Viejo. This full-service resort boasts two excellent 18-hole courses of championship quality that have played host to the PGA Tour Qualifying School for Curtis Strange, Craig Stadler, and Peter Jacobson, as well as the likes of Willie Nelson and Dean Martin who have participated in the club's annual Hacker's Tournament.El Diablo (the devil) is the most demanding of the two layouts and earns its name with a design that features water on nine holes, ten dogleg holes, and large, undulating greens that are easy three-putts. Palm trees and tropical vegetation provide problems and out-of-bounds is always a factor, since the course sometimes routes between houses.Hole 3 is one of the most difficult, a 440-yard dogleg left with water affecting both the drive and the approach. No. 14 is a long par 5 that doglegs twice around a lake, and the par 3 No. 16 plays 224 yards from the tips. The tee shot on 16 carries 120 yards of what was once part of the Rio Grande River.

In 1996 Williams & Gill upgraded the course and added a bit of length to the flat terrain.

Two par 5s stand out on the Old Course. No. 2 plays a whopping 618 yards, and the 18th goes 511 yards with water all along the right side and four bunkers protecting the green. This final hole marks the end of an extremely tough finish to the course, since water is in play on the final five holes.The New Course opened seven years later to accommodate the demand created by new residents. Known as a shot-maker's track, the design features heavy bunkering, impressive lakes, and demanding, elevated greens. This course has as much or more water than its older brother.You'll need precision tee shots during the round, especially on the 331-yard No. 16-it plays into a dogleg-left fairway and features an approach over a huge bunker in front of the green.Other notes: Raveneaux is the name of the place where Napoleon took time to relax.

18504,River Oaks Country Club,"River Oaks isn't the oldest, but it's definitely one of the preeminent names in Houston golf. Dating back to 1925 when Houston was hardly exposed to the game of golf, Philadelphian Jack Burke Sr. became the first head pro, no long before Sam Snead and Ben Hogan began coming to the club to work on their game. A new generation of golfers like Jimmy Demaret and Claude Harmon, Sr. (Butch's dad) came along, and River Oaks earned a reputation as the hub of Houston golf.Designed by the legendary Donald Ross, River Oaks is a timeless, traditional layout that is one of the most exclusive in the country. The high-dollar real estate that Ross had to work with was small, but covered with stately old oak trees and ancient pines all nestled along the banks of Buffalo Bayou.The layout features some of the area's best short holes-distance isn't an issue, but accuracy is imperative. In addition to the oaks and pines, the skinny fairways are lined with azaleas, magnolias, and dogwoods. The greens are small, slick, and make for challenging targets.Other notes: Joe Finger came along in 1967 to initiate improvements of the greens, tees, and the rerouting of a few holes.Getting there : From I-45 south take the Hwy. 610 exit west and find Westheimer Rd.

No. 4 is tough because the creek rolls along the left side of the 561-yard hole before crossing in front of the green. And No. 7 is one of the toughest: a 430-yard doglegger that bends right around the creek.The back side has a few ponds that come into play, but is void of the pesky creek.

18512,Riverhill Country Club,"Riverhill’s architect, Joe Finger, is a well-traveled Renaissance man who has dabbled in everything from corrugated plastics and dairy farming to college golf and course development. So it says something that he chose Riverhill Country Club as his home. Consistently rated as one of the top courses in all of Texas, Riverhill is a scenic layout with major elevation changes; undulating, elevated greens; lots of water and tough Hill Country brush that wreaks havoc on errant balls.Leon Howard designed the course originally as a 9-hole layout back in 1952, but members eventually commissioned Byron Nelson and Ralph Plummer to improve the layout. Plummer became ill, opening the door for Finger’s contributions. One of his most challenging holes is No. 11, a par 3 that sometimes plays around 200 yards from the tips. With the wind blowing and water on all along the right side, it’s an intimidating tee shot when you’re aiming at the tiny green.Hole 4 is the most difficult rated hole, a 458-yard par 4. Another tough challenge is the long par 5 14th, which happens to be proceeded by another long par 5, creating a tough stretch of golf on the back side.Getting there : From I-10 west, take Hwy. 16 south. When you come to Hwy. 173, turn toward Bandera and drive to Riverhill Club Ln . Turn right and the course is just down the road",https://riverhillcc.com/,,,,,,
