5177,Inverness Club,"Inverness Club in Toledo is one of the Midwest’s most prestigious tournament venues. The club was founded in 1903 and hired Donald Ross in 1916 to design a championship-caliber, 18-hole course. He delivered, and the 1920 U.S. Open was soon held here. It has hosted four U.S. Opens, two PGA Championships and a U.S. Amateur. It is also the host of the 2020 LPGA Drive On Championship and 2021 Solheim Cup. The course has been renovated, expanded and redesigned over the 100-plus years of existence. Architect Andrew Green extensively restored the Donald Ross layout in 2018, while also adding some new features as a result of property expansion. The cathedral clock, still on display in the clubhouse, was presented by the participants of the 1920 U.S. Open, and Inverness was the first club to permit the players into the member’s clubhouse. Inverness’ crest is inscribed with the Latin words “Concordia et Fidelitas,” which translates to “Harmony and Faithfulness.”",https://invernessclub.com/,,,,,,
