The parkland-style layout rolls through hills of native grasses and wildflowers, sweeping around three lakes that spice up the course.The duo’s design isn’t overly long, playing only 7,020 yards from the tips, but it boasts three par 4s over 450 yards and several long par 5s, including the 647-yard No. 6. This monster doglegs left inside a cliff that runs along the right side. Out-of-bounds is left, and a fairway bunker resides about a lob wedge from the narrow green, which is bolstered from behind by more bunkers.No. 18 is one of the more interesting finishing holes that you’ll come across, featuring two dogleg fairways, one right and one left, that both involve dealing with the creek that splits the two routes.

The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times.

The nine-hole layout offers beautiful views of the bay and Morro Rock from almost every hole.

Thomas, Jr., who created the Riviera, collaborated with Billy Bell to design the original golf course but Jay Morrish made the layout considerably more challenging with renovations in 1988. Ten years later, two holes from the original Thomas/Bell layout that were lost during a redesign following WWII were completely restored and incorporated into the layout.

The former is the short 6th hole, with a pot bunker in the middle of the sweeping, multi-tiered green. The latter: the 10th, whose broad fairway and strategic bunkering gives way to one of the toughest-to-hit putting surfaces in the world. Even the best golfers in the world routinely make scores from 2 to 8 there.In addition to the PGA Tour’s annual Genesis Invitational, Riviera has a considerable major championship pedigree, including a U.S. Open (1948) and two PGA Championships (1983, 1995).",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14936,,,,,,

Remember, this is the golf mecca with Pete Dye's Stadium Course, which was only designed to be ""the toughest golf course in the world."" Desert Falls is on that list.There are five sets of tees to take away some of the bite. But the greens are still an obstacle of their own. These are undulating greens that are large enough to offer several varieties of challenges.Just getting on the green is not enough at Desert Falls.

The legendary architect made his home off the par-5 sixth hole and regarded the difficult, uphill 16th as one of the best par 4s ever designed by him or anyone else. To make it even better, the golf club embarked on a two-year restoration project headed up by Tom Doak. The result was nothing less than spectacular as bunkers and greens were to returned original specifications with modern turf and drainage technology. With its great design and elevation changes, Pasatiempo Golf Club plays much longer than its yardage and will test good players. The back nine is particularly strong, perhaps as good as any in the country.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15566,,,,,,

The demanding course along with its natural landscape and wildlife of the area create a truly unique golfing experience for guests at Interlocken Golf Club. Definitely not at many golf courses can golfers see a coyote or fox wandering about during their game. Golf Magazine ranked it as the third ""Best Course in the Rocky Mountain Area.""",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/47,,,,,,

Their thoughtful placement makes up the bulk of the layout's challenges. There are ponds that come into play on six holes as well as tall native grasses that appear along the fairways and greens.

The par-70 layout is player friendly enough for beginners but low handicappers will also find it to be a fun round. The holes are fairly straightforward though there are some fairways that have very narrow landing areas that will test the accuracy of even the best golfers. Numerous bunkers are strategically placed along the undulating greens and water also comes into play on the occasional hole. The golf course starts out gently but becomes progressively more challenging on the back nine. The most memorable hole on the golf course, the par-3 12th, is a water hole that features an intimidating island green.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/4447,,,,,,

The course is also home to an abundance of wildlife that includes several different bird species, deer, fox, otters, and even alligators. The front nine starts off gently with a more traditional design but it's the back nine, which weaves through beautiful wetlands, that will test your accuracy. River Pointe Golf Club's signature hole is the par-5 14th. This lengthy hole has water all along the left side and in front of the green, which slopes from back to front.

The front nine has a wide-open links-style layout that provides an interesting contrast to the back nine, which is characterized by tree-lined, narrow fairways. The greens are large and undulating and sometimes framed with strategically placed bunkers. The golf course winds through scenic coastal marshes and wetlands, which come into play on 13 holes.

The terrain is mostly flat, making it an enjoyable course to walk. Despite its length the holes have the feel of a championship course. There are 14 par 3s, a fair share of which are quite challenging as opposed to the uniform par 3s you see on some executive courses.

It may not be the most formidable golf course in the area, but it shouldn't be underestimated either. The course strikes a good balance between being forgiving enough for high handicappers and challenging enough for more advanced players. The par 3s are tough and the diverse par 4s come in all shapes and sizes. Royal Lakes Golf & C.C. is a shot maker's layout that requires accuracy and thoughtful strategy.

The two hired the eclectic Scotsman Desmond Muirhead to design the course on 190 acres of former cotton fields.In the 1980s, the LPGA and Senior PGA tours frequently hosted tournaments at Bent Tree, and the course was eventually renovated in 1990. The improvements focused on the front nine (which is still more open than the back), spicing up the layout with bunkering, tree additions, and adjustments to greens.Water comes into play on 14 of 18 holes, and the course is quite long if you play from the tips. The best hole on the front is No. 3, a long par 5 that plays almost 600 yards. The narrow fairway chutes between water on the left and bunkers on the right, and the small green slopes severely to the water on the left side.The more interesting back nine offers a nice stretch of golf on holes 13-15. No. 14 is the most scenic on the course because it plays downhill at least 75 feet to a green surrounded on three sides by water. The 387-yard 18th is the perfect finishing hole–not too long but plenty challenging.Getting there : From I-635 east, take the Dallas North Tollway and exit Westgrove.

Maxwell wanted to maintain the natural beauty of the landscape and he successfully incorporated it into elements of the course. Another trace of Applewood Golf Course's scenic appeal is in the wildlife that is often spotted by golfers.

The greens often feature slopes and undulations but they are fair and they roll true. They are also known for being excellently maintained. Mature trees frame many of the holes and there are several strategically placed bunkers lurking throughout.

There is only one water hazard that comes into play, but it still manages to add a lot of character. The views spanning across Lake Isabella are almost enough of a reason to play the golf course.

There are a few water hazards that come into play as well as the occasional bunker, but overall the course is gentle enough for beginners to approach it with confidence.

Golf at Callaway Gardens is a unique experience in that you'll be completely submerged in nature and surrounded by wildlife. The resort’s two golf courses, Lake View and Mountain View, are challenging enough for avid golfers but they are scenic and playable enough to appeal to players of all skill levels. The Lake View Course is the original layout. It offers a slightly more player-friendly round with wider fairways and generous greens. There are more water holes on this golf course, nine total, including five holes that are routed along Mountain Creek Lake.

The fairways are fairly generous, and most of the greens have deceptive undulations.During the round you’ll notice the long, challenging par 4s. Particularly the 405 yard No. 11, where a creek cuts into the fairway twice, framing the landing area off the tee. No. 3 is also tough, playing 446 yards and forcing another carry of a creek that cuts into the fairway. The 17th is another solid par 4–not as long, but picturesque because the green is completely surrounded by water.Finally, the feature that rounds out the experience at Wildflower is the great condition of the course, enhanced by the new irrigation system that keeps the fairways lush and the greens healthy and rolling true.Getting there : From I-35 north, exit Midway Drive and turn left.

His dream eventually became a peaceful retirement community with a beautiful 18-hole course as its centerpiece. The Arthur Hills-designed layout is one of the toughest par-60 golf courses in southwest Florida. There are two streams that cut across the course and intersect on the front nine. They snake along every hole, making water the predominant hazard but there are also several strategically placed bunkers to watch out for. The golf course is mostly open with a few cypress trees dotted along the fairways and greens. Myerlee Golf & C.C. is a course that will test your skills but it isn't overly punishing, which gives it appeal for beginners as well.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15484,,,,,,

The rolling fairways are often wide and generous off the tee and the sand dunes, which stretch from tee too green, are only punishing of the most errant of shots. The approach shots though are as demanding as the tee shots are forgiving. There are numerous bunkers fiercely guarding the large, smooth greens.

The course is player enough for beginners and while it may not be what you're looking for if you're in search of a formidable test, it's good for some casual practice for the more advanced player. The layout balances player-friendly, wide fairways with greens that are guarded by strategically placed bunkers. There is a series of lakes and streams throughout the golf course that come into play on nearly every hole. The golf course has seen several improvements since it first opened in 1969, especially after it was badly damaged from a hurricane. More than 200 trees were added as well as 1,200 grasses and shrubs. Hibiscus Golf Club also has a driving range and putting green.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/14030,,,,,,

Gordon Lewis oversaw a complete transformation of the course that has made it more challenging yet still playable. The layout has an interesting variety of holes that consist of three par 5s, nine par 4s, and six par 3s. The terrain has a few subtle undulations but overall it is mostly flat, making it an enjoyable course for walkers.

The improvements focused on the front nine (which is still more open than the back), spicing up the layout with bunkering, tree additions, and adjustments to greens.Water comes into play on 14 of 18 holes, and the course is quite long if you play from the tips. The best hole on the front is No. 3, a long par 5 that plays almost 600 yards. The narrow fairway chutes between water on the left and bunkers on the right, and the small green slopes severely to the water on the left side.The more interesting back nine offers a nice stretch of golf on holes 13-15. No. 14 is the most scenic on the course because it plays downhill at least 75 feet to a green surrounded on three sides by water.

The undulating, tree-lined fairways were designed to mimic a hilly New England course but the moss-covered cypresses, palm trees, and marshy swamplands are true to the Florida landscape. The layout features tight fairways framed with contoured mounding and the occasional water hazard but the most formidable challenge comes from the bunkers strategically placed along the undulating greens.

To commemorate 40 years of great golf, the course was remodeled and revamped in 2002. The renovations improved its playability and also made it more challenging. The championship-caliber layout features strategically placed bunkers, including some Scottish-style sod-faced ones, and tricky water hazards on several holes. The hilly terrain offers both challenging elevation changes and scenic views. The golf course finishes with a long par 5 that plays across a canyon of berms to a narrow fairway. Further accuracy is needed to reach the well guarded green surrounded by high berms, a pot bunker to the left, and a deep, steep bunker to the right. In addition to the course, Makray Memorial G.C. boasts an extensive practice facility with 1 1/2 acres of grass teeing ground, two putting greens, and a short-game area.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15996,,,,,,

Though the design of the layout has fluctuated, Crab Orchard is known among locals for consistently offering superb conditions. The scenic golf course features lush fairways winding through stands of mature oak trees. Water hazards come into play on half of the holes and the small greens have subtle breaks, which can make them difficult to read. The golf course is quite formidable from the championship tees but the forward and middle tees make it approachable for all skill levels.

In addition, more than 10,000 railroad ties were used to create another classic Dye design.

The fairways are generous and forgiving though. The course is a fair test but it is especially tough on windy days. The interior, tree-lined holes contrast nicely with the waterfront holes and they have the added benefit of protection from the prevailing sea breezes.

When we originally called to schedule a round that we ended up avoiding, we were abruptly told by the older gentleman who answered the phone that the course wasn’t open to the public.

Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

This is definitely not a golf course where you can just grip it and rip it. The fairways are fairly straight and forgiving, but most of the approach shots play to tricky elevated greens. There are also strategically placed bunkers framing the greens and water hazards come into play on several holes as well.

Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3302,,,,,,

Only a few holes remained from the original nine-hole course, but they play just as they did in the 20s. The newer front nine has a link-style design that demands accuracy off the tee with 29 sand traps strategically placed throughout the nine holes. There are a variety of other hazards as well. As you move onto the back nine, the golf course's character changes completely. The holes have a traditional design and they are much more wooded with mature trees framing almost every hole, just waiting to knock down an errant tee shot or missed approach.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13909,,,,,,

The par-72 course that exists today tumbles across a variety of elevation changes that range from subtle to dramatic. The golf course is mostly wide open, putting it at the mercy of the prevailing winds. On particularly blustery days, Crystal Woods Golf Club is quite demanding. The 12th is the course’s signature and it even has a reputation for being the most difficult hole in McHenry County. It’s tempting to be distracted by the beautiful view from the elevated tee but this tough hole requires your full attention. The double-tiered green rises dramatically from front to back, often demanding three or more putts.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/5619,,,,,,

Robert Trent Jones designed the course, taking advantage of the panoramic views of Kedron Valley and the scenic and varied terrain. The golf course has a classic design that stretches to just over 6,000 yards from the back tees. Though the holes may seem short by modern standards, you'll soon find out that they require thought and will test your shot-making skills. Water comes into play in the form of a long, meandering creek that traverses the length of the course. It feeds into a large lake that comes into play on the 12th and 13th holes.

Only 1/4 mile away from the ocean, the back nine is a more open layout similar to Dye's PGA West course and play is influenced by the prevailing ocean wind.Prestwick features 8 holes where water comes into play.Over 1.3 million cubic yards of earth were moved in creating towering Scottish berms, stairway and church pew bunkers, and undulating greens. In addition, more than 10,000 railroad ties were used to create another classic Dye design. Dramatic elevation changes ranging up to thirty feet add an exceptional feature to this coastal location.Prestwick has been recognized as one of South Carolina's top golf courses and remains enjoyable with extremely limited non-member play and great year-round course conditioning.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12326,,,,,,

The golf course can be very demanding at times, specifically on the fourth hole. This par 4 is wooded from tee to green on both sides and requires a tee shot over a narrow creek before turning up a steep hill to a dramatically undulating green.

Carefully carved from mature forests of oak and pine trees, the course is abundant with native wildlife. The course dates back to 1926 but it underwent a major renovation in 2003 that made certain aspects more challenging, while also making it more playable for a wider range of skill levels. The layout is much like playing two golf courses in one with a front nine that is tightly lined with trees and a hillier back nine that wraps around a large lake. There are also a few small ponds that come into play on the front nine. The rolling terrain guarantees uneven lies as well as the occasional blind shot.

Bendelow designed 800-plus North American courses, working with land he was assigned: In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, architects didn't get their turf, rocks and water features trucked in. Born Sept. 2, 1868, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bendelow began golfing when he was 9 years old, with his dad at the Balgownie Links, which now goes by Royal Aberdeen Golf Club - founded in 1780, Royal Aberdeen Golf Club is the world's sixth-oldest, and it's clear that Bendelow had rich inspiration to draw on back in Scotland.After a round of golf at the Western Hills Country Club, head back to the Grill Porch for nibbles and sips.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10555,,,,,,

Oak Hurst is also well known for its large, well-bunkered, undulating greens and water that comes into play on over half of the holes.The number-one-rated hole is No. 10, a challenging 595-yard par 5 that welcomes golfers who’ve allowed their concentration to wane at the turn.

The country club sits just 10 minutes outside of downtown Cincinnati.A Scottish golfer and designer, Bendelow created several Midwest courses. Bendelow designed 800-plus North American courses, working with land he was assigned: In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, architects didn't get their turf, rocks and water features trucked in. Born Sept. 2, 1868, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bendelow began golfing when he was 9 years old, with his dad at the Balgownie Links, which now goes by Royal Aberdeen Golf Club - founded in 1780, Royal Aberdeen Golf Club is the world's sixth-oldest, and it's clear that Bendelow had rich inspiration to draw on back in Scotland.After a round of golf at the Western Hills Country Club, head back to the Grill Porch for nibbles and sips.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10555,,,,,,

Dennis Griffiths, the course's architect, seamlessly blended the design with the natural features of the landscape. The abundant natural water hazards come into play on half the holes and Griffiths strategically incorporated several well placed bunkers. The terrain's gentle undulations provide some interesting slope in the greens that place a priority on accuracy. Bent Tree Golf Club's par-4 eighth hole is especially demanding. It may be short at only 334 yards but it is surrounded by bunkers on all sides. It is followed by another tricky par 4 that requires both distance and accuracy in order to navigate the tree-lined fairway uphill to an undulating green faced with bunkers to the front and back.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1310,,,,,,

The layout has many risk-reward opportunities and the par-3 holes are especially fun. The hilly terrain is as scenic as it is challenging, providing some tricky uneven lies and there is a meandering creek that slithers along the fairways. Though it's wide open, the golf course requires a bit of accuracy and some good course management. The elevated tees offer some spectacular views as well as some intimidating approaches to the fast, undulating greens.

Pro golfers such as Tommy Bolt, Charles Coody, Don Cherry, Mike Standly, and Bob Estes have all spent time here.The fairways are generous and the layout is loaded with bunkers. The track’s first hole of note is the beautiful 360-yard par 4 No. 5, which doglegs left. Locals aim at the three oaks on the right side of the fairway and work their draw. The most difficult hole is the 390-yard par 4 ninth hole, which plays uphill into the wind with an approach that must carry water. Hole 14 (190 yards) is also tough, requiring a long iron with the wind–which makes it impossible at times to hold the green, and is especially treacherous with water front and left of the green.Getting there : From I-20 west, exit 83/84 and take the Buffalo Gap exit.

Dennis Griffiths, the course's architect, seamlessly blended the design with the natural features of the landscape. The abundant natural water hazards come into play on half the holes and Griffiths strategically incorporated several well placed bunkers. The terrain's gentle undulations provide some interesting slope in the greens that place a priority on accuracy. Bent Tree Golf Club's par-4 eighth hole is especially demanding. It may be short at only 334 yards but it is surrounded by bunkers on all sides. It is followed by another tricky par 4 that requires both distance and accuracy in order to navigate the tree-lined fairway uphill to an undulating green faced with bunkers to the front and back.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1310,,,,,,

The golf course is interwoven with a meandering creek that is connected to three ponds, all of which come into play on several holes throughout the course. The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings. Meadowbrook C.C. has hosted several events over the years, including numerous Wisconsin state opens.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/1750,,,,,,

No matter who you talk to in the DFW area, they all seem to praise the superb condition of the course from tee to green. Offering a 7,078-yard par 71 Jay Morrish/Tom Weiskopf design, Buffalo Creek offers a good combination of holes: straight holes, dogleggers, uphill and downhill shots, and both long and short holes.One of the best features is the club’s method of using a pin location sheet to mark exactly where each pin is located on a particular day (up to six locations), which is unbelievably helpful to hacks who’ve never played the course before and have no feel for the look and contour of the greens.Getting there : Take I-30 east from Dallas and exit Ridge Rd.

The golf course also enjoys panoramic views of the Sacramento Valley. Massive rock outcroppings border the fairways, calling for some creative shot making. Accuracy is also a necessity with meandering creeks and bunkers coming into play on most holes. The layout is challenging but five sets of tees make the golf course approachable for a variety of skill levels.

They persevered with their idea and eventually established an 18-hole, par-72 course right in Cumberland Center. The golf course has a traditional layout that is heavily lined with trees. Accuracy is an important part of the round but if you can manage to hit straight, you'll have a good game. Strategically placed bunkers also lurk along the greensides and fairways.

Shorty was a hacker and his short course is designed to accommodate the lesser golfer with its executive-like 2,385-yard length.Plaster's design opens up with three par 3s, followed by another on No. 5. Every par 4 plays 350 yards or less, and the sole par 5 is only 475 yards. Not many non-par-3 9-holers are blessed with lights, but this one is. The same goes for the driving range, so you can definitely spend some hours at this nice little country course.Getting there : From I-45 south, exit Dixie Farm Rd. and turn right.

With plenty of variety among all of the holes, the layout will test your skill with different types of shots.

Nestled in the rolling hills of central Main, the golf course runs alongside the river that created its namesake valley. The scenic landscape is covered with mature trees, which are concentrated along the undulating fairways. The original design was slightly tweaked in 2001 to make it both more challenging and more playable. The green sizes were reduced and bunkers were shifted or removed. The result was a golf course that is challenging enough for more advanced players but still gentle enough for beginners to approach with confidence. The classic elements of Ross' design still manage to shine though, which has cemented Penobscot Valley Country Club's status as a Maine tradition.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/6862,,,,,,

Having two different designers gives the golf course plenty of variety, especially since the holes are intermingles. Cornish's greens are bigger and flatter while the Ross holes feature some of his characteristic greens and bunkers. Water hazards come into play as well and you'll face a few tricky doglegs and blind shots. There are some challenging holes but overall it's not an overly difficult golf course. The average player can still approach it with confidence. With a secluded location in rural western Massachusetts, Ellinwood Country Club offers beautiful views of the surrounding countryside. The 11th hole, with a winding brook that runs alongside the fairway before cutting in front of the green, is particularly scenic.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/7039,,,,,,

There are six ponds that come into play on half of the holes as well as nearly 40 strategically placed sand bunkers throughout. The course's signature hole is the par-4 ninth hole. This tricky hole features water along the right side of the fairway and green and out-of-bounds stakes along the left, as well as a large sand bunker lurking treacherously behind the green.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10725,,,,,,

There have been many changes over the years, including opening to the public in 1965 and the addition of another nine holes in 1974. At just over 6,000 yards, it's a short course by modern standards but it's no pushover. The greens are known for being challenging and they are also some of the truest and smoothest putting surfaces you'll find in the area. Though length may not be required, accuracy and course management are essential. The hazards at Marshfield C.C. are mostly provided by the existing landscape, including the meandering creeks, mature trees, and rocky outcroppings, which are complemented by several strategically placed bunkers. Each hole offers a different test, beginning with a tough par 4. This dogleg left hole has a stream that cuts right through the center.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13737,,,,,,

The club underwent yet another multi-million dollar renovation in 2012 when the club changed ownership. In the most recent renovation, hundreds of extraneous trees were cleared from the fairways in order to get it back into pristine condition. Although it's a seemingly short layout at just over 6,200 yards from the back tees, it actually plays much longer. The first two holes are laid across the hilliest portion of the terrain.

Originally designed by Donald Ross in 1898, the golf course is one of Ohio's oldest and it stands as one of the most original and unaltered Ross designs in the country. At just over 6,684 yards, the classic layout runs a bit shorter than most courses built today. It is a challenging layout but it is also very forgiving, making it more accommodating for beginning and intermediate players. The club has built its longstanding reputation on the player-friendly Ross design and the excellent course conditions, cementing it as one of the area's favorites. Besides golf, Springfield Country Club also offers an Olympic-sized swimming pool with a slide and six tennis courts.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/10991,,,,,,

Opened in 1956, the 18-hole course has a traditional layout that is shorter than most modern courses. Despite the relatively short length, there are plenty of challenges in store on this golf course. The greens are severely sloped and they play lightning fast. More often than not, you'll find that they're flanked by strategically placed bunkers as well. There are also water hazards that come into play on several holes. The golf course appeals to a wide range of skill levels since it's not overly punishing for high handicappers and there are risk-reward opportunities for more advanced players.

The golf course is not as seemingly easy as one would think since the open landscape is also subject to strong winds. There are also stands of mature trees throughout as well as waste areas that are waiting to swallow up errant shots.

The large greens and wide fairways make the course very playable for the average amateur while still a test for the lower handicapper. The course designer, Mark Muller, has created something of real significance, and the variation of holes together with the proximity of the City of Cape Town metropolitan area makes this a “must be played” course.The course is parkland in design with Bent Grass greens and Kikuyu fairways. 4 different species of local grasses have been planted in various areas of the rough, giving the course a very distinctive look.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/18094,,,,,,

The terrain is level allowing for easy walking with no hills to climb.The 12th hole, a 421-yard par-4 with a left to right dogleg, is generally regarded as the best hole on the golf course.

Water comes into play on almost every hole and there are several forced carries. This can be one of the most challenging (and frustrating) courses in the area if you're not hitting the ball straight. It's possible to empty your ball bag on this course on a bad day.Favorite holes are number 4 and number 10 (now some other number because the back nine was reordered during 1997). Number 4 is a par 4 which requires a blind tee shot over a marsh. Too short or left and you're dead in the marsh, too far right and you're either wet or are faced with a long second shot. Number 10 (maybe 12 now) is a par five that offers several ways to attack, all of them dangerous. If you go for the green in 2 you have to carry the entire length of a pond. To lay up you have to hit a narrow fairway and risk going too far through and out of bounds.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12822,,,,,,

It's less than an hour from Atlanta, making it a conveniently close getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. The course originally opened in 1990 but in 2008 it changed ownership and underwent a major renovation that elevated its conditions to rival that of any of the area's best golf courses. The bunkers were rebuilt and re-sanded and the fairways were re-conditioned. Bear Creek G.C. has always been known for its excellent greens, which have a reputation for being some of the state's finest putting surfaces. The layout measures 6,585 yards from the back tees, which may seem short but there are some ups and downs throughout that will make it feel much longer.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/24773,,,,,,

The golf course is home to the longest cart bridge in the country, stretching almost 1,500 feet to bring golfers from the bay-side holes to the marshland holes. It is also the only course in the U.S. with five consecutive holes playing to the same double green.

The yardage is seemingly short but the hazards that come into play throughout make it seem much longer. The golf course offers two distinct layouts that make for an interesting round. The front nine is wide open with some room for error but the back nine is routed through woodlands, demanding accuracy and thoughtful strategy. There is an interesting variety of holes as well including short par 4s, moderate par 5s, and tough par 3s that are made even more difficult on a windy days.

The course’s namesake waterway slinks its way through the course, coming into play six times as you wind your way through the tree-lined fairways.Holes of note include the 470-yard, par 4 No. 6, which dives through a chute of trees to a large green. Thankfully, this monster is void of hazards. On the back No. 13 is feast or famine–a short par 5 at 483 yards, but a pond sits in the middle of the fairway. The ender at Cedar Creek goes 520 yards and is fairly manageable if you can keep it out of the trees.Getting there : From Hwy. 175 east, take the Kemp exit, and look for the signs to the course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3068,,,,,,

There have been many changes over the years, including opening to the public in 1965 and the addition of another nine holes in 1974. At just over 6,000 yards, it's a short course by modern standards but it's no pushover. The greens are known for being challenging and they are also some of the truest and smoothest putting surfaces you'll find in the area. Though length may not be required, accuracy and course management are essential. The hazards at Marshfield C.C. are mostly provided by the existing landscape, including the meandering creeks, mature trees, and rocky outcroppings, which are complemented by several strategically placed bunkers. Each hole offers a different test, beginning with a tough par 4. This dogleg left hole has a stream that cuts right through the center.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/13737,,,,,,

The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is.

Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3302,,,,,,

The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times. Other multiple winners of this longstanding PGA Tour event include Lee Trevino, Billy Casper, Nick Price and Ben Crenshaw.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/21496,,,,,,

Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/3302,,,,,,

The layout is challenging but playable with elevation changes and strategically placed bunkers that are balanced by large greens and wide, player-friendly fairways. One of the golf course's most memorable holes is the par-5 second. This challenging 530-yard hole plays around a massive lake but with an accurate second shot, it is reachable in two.

The layout is routed through freshwater lagoons and marshes, which means you'll be facing water on several holes. Rolling dunes provide subtle but challenging contours throughout the course as well. The terrain is tough enough but there are also the ever-present winds to contend with. For some scenic respite from this formidable test, scenic views of the Atlantic can be enjoyed on almost every hole.

The back nine is longer and there are more trees and penalty ditches.

The landscape of rolling dunes is covered with native grasses but completely devoid of trees. Tall sand bunkers are strategically placed throughout and there are also expansive waste areas, both characteristics that are true to its links nature. Water hazards come into play on several holes as well. Accurate shot placement is the key to doing well on this course and just like any seaside links layout, the coastal breezes play a prominent role.

The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times.

The challenging layout demands accuracy and it will also test your shot-making skills. Golfers should expect to utilize every club in their bag. The golf course features tight fairways lined with mature trees, tricky doglegs, and multi-tiered greens that can be difficult to read. The rolling terrain also promises difficult uphill and downhill lies. Bunkers are strategically placed throughout and there is water on a few holes. A windy day adds yet another formidable element to the challenging design. The diverse layout has a mix of difficult par 3s, reachable par 5s, and a few birdie opportunities. Hidden Valley Golf Club will definitely test your skills, but five sets of tees make the course more approachable to a wide range of skill levels.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/15453,,,,,,

This beautiful links-style course offers open fairways and undulating greens where stiff winds can interfere with drives and cause high shots to blow wildly off course.When the 9-hole course originally opened on the high-toned North Beach, President William Howard Taft was in Texas to visit his brother, who owned a ranch across Nueces Bay. Taft participated in the opening ceremonies in front of the green wooden building which is distinguished by its white trim and veranda on all four sides.The course fell victim to the 1919 hurricane, and club members didn't reorganize until 1921. John Bredemus came down from Del Rio after the completion of the San Felipe Springs Country Club and immediately put crewmen to work clearing and grading for $1.50 a day. The fairways and greens were fertilized with cottonseed meal, and the first shot was fired on Labor Day, 1922. At the time, this course on the Texas Riviera was considered one of the finest in the country.At the end of the Depression, oil was discovered under the course and wells produced from 1936 to 1943, increasing revenues but creating some interesting man-made hazards in the layout. By 1938, the club expanded the course to 18 holes.

If you survive the tee shot, you’re still faced with a long approach into a multi-tiered green surrounded by sand.Of the notable holes on the front, No. 3 is loaded with fairway bunkers and water, and holes 7 and 9 share a tee box and require solid drives to reach the fairway.Other notes: While Hollytree is a private facility, the club allows USGA members who live at least 50 miles outside of Tyler to play.Getting there : From I-20 east, exit Tyler/Lindale and turn right.

Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984.

Let’s list the reasons: Location: Far north Dallas, with White Rock Creek meandering through. Layout: Stunning and traditional, with tree-lined fairways, the right amount of water and bunkering, and huge, lightning-fast bent-grass greens. Feel: Cart paths run the way they should--from greens to tees, not the other way around. And caddies are always available to promote playing the game on foot. Mystique: Memorabilia of professional tour players who are also members is tastefully distributed throughout the clubhouse, and the shrine to Mickey Mantle (a longtime member) is awe-inspiring. You’ll need serious connections to play this course, but here are some highlights.The third hole is a 591-yard par 5 with a narrow tee shot that opens to a wide landing area. The homes lining the right side of the fairway no doubt shelter some of the most jealous people in the world. The second shot begins to run down the dramatic slope that ends in a huge green in front of the creek.The next par 5, the 498 yard 6th, has a similar slope which begins in the landing area of your drive. If you really pop it and have the wind, you’ll be at the base of the hill with about 175 yards left to the large, two-tiered green. Be careful, though–it’s protected by dense woods on the left and back, and water on the front and right.The 7th hole is the number one handicap. This 422-yard par 4 dogleg right requires a perfectly faded and long tee shot to get far enough into the throat to approach. You’ll still be hitting a long iron or wood into the severely back-to-front sloped green, and good luck making the putt from above the hole.The back nine is maybe the best anywhere, but two holes stand out above the rest. The 16th is a 428-yard par 4 with a slight dogleg left. The tee shot is elevated at least 100 yards above where the green sits. A big, high draw will put you about 150 yards away from the two-tiered green, which is protected by the creek in front. They really like to put the pin on the lower tier right in front of the creek, which gives you about 20 square yards to work with. It’s a lay-up hole for all but the longest and bravest.The 422-yard dogleg-right finishing hole is almost a mirror of the 16th–it’s a long dogleg right, all uphill. The tee area is extremely narrow from the tips, and the fairway slopes to the left to make shaving the corner as hard as possible. This ends up being a 5 par for most, and the outcome of many Nassaus is changed on this hole.It’s hard to describe this course without gushing, not to mention that hearing about it just frustrates most people because they won’t have a chance to see it for themselves. But keep your eyes and ears open for friends who may be members and schmooze them as much as possible–it will surely be worth the effort.The details : 972-380-0669. 17201 Preston Trail Dr., Dallas, TX 752481965.

Dating back to 1925 when Houston was hardly exposed to the game of golf, Philadelphian Jack Burke Sr. became the first head pro, no long before Sam Snead and Ben Hogan began coming to the club to work on their game. A new generation of golfers like Jimmy Demaret and Claude Harmon, Sr. (Butch's dad) came along, and River Oaks earned a reputation as the hub of Houston golf.Designed by the legendary Donald Ross, River Oaks is a timeless, traditional layout that is one of the most exclusive in the country. The high-dollar real estate that Ross had to work with was small, but covered with stately old oak trees and ancient pines all nestled along the banks of Buffalo Bayou.The layout features some of the area's best short holes-distance isn't an issue, but accuracy is imperative. In addition to the oaks and pines, the skinny fairways are lined with azaleas, magnolias, and dogwoods. The greens are small, slick, and make for challenging targets.Other notes: Joe Finger came along in 1967 to initiate improvements of the greens, tees, and the rerouting of a few holes.Getting there : From I-45 south take the Hwy. 610 exit west and find Westheimer Rd.

In 1985, the course played host to the PGA Senior Tour's Hilton Head Seniors International.Playing to 6,625 yards, with an impressive 139 slope rating from the tips, Planter's Row is different from its sister courses at Port Royal with a park-type setting and tree-lined fairways. The challenge will come at the greens, which Byrd made undulating and treacherous.Prior to getting to the green, water will often come into play, ready to drown your ball in return for a penalty stroke.

Pete Dye designed the golf course, crafting a number of memorable holes. It's his only design in the Midlands. No two holes are alike on this challenging layout, so expect to use every club in your bag. The golf course offers a variety of risk-reward opportunities that will appeal to both low and high handicappers. There are also five, and sometimes six, tee boxes on every hole, making the golf course even more appealing for any skill level. The fairways are generous but lined with mature hardwoods and there are strategically placed bunkers to contend with. Golfers at The Windemere Club will also encounter subtle but tricky elevation changes and several lakes and ponds.",https://www.golfpass.com/travel-advisor/xgo/12141,,,,,,
