5600,Carolina Lakes Golf Course,"Carolina Lakes is the golf course at Shaw Air Force Base near Sumter. It is a military course that is not open to the public. In terms of military courses, this layout stands out for not being a typical pitch-and-putt. The golf course is just under 6,500 yards from the back tees, offering a good mix of length with some shorter holes. With water hazards coming into play on several holes as well as a good number of strategically placed bunkers, it is a course that will make you think. There are also a variety of elevation changes that are seemingly subtle but can cause more problems than you think. One particularly memorable hole is the first par 3 you reach on the front nine, which requires a forced carry over a pond.",https://www.thebestfss.com/recreation/carolina-lakes-golf-course,,,,,,

5608,Crescent Pointe Golf Club,"Crescent Pointe Golf Club in Bluffton is Arnold Palmer's only public course in the area. It is conveniently located just a few minutes west of the bridge leaving Hilton Head Island. Opened in 2000, the course has quickly gained a reputation as being one of the Lowcountry's best. Sprawling across a lush landscape blanketed with century-old oaks and towering pines, the layout is as scenic as it is challenging. While the generous fairways may be player friendly, the difficult approaches to the elevated, well bunkered greens are anything but. The large, pristine white sand bunkers were designed in true Palmer-style, closely following the natural undulations of the land. The gently rolling terrain is unique for the area. Crescent Pointe Golf Club's elevation changes aren't dramatic but they do provide some subtle, but tricky undulations in the greens that make it hard to find a flat lie.",https://crescentpointegolf.com/,,,,,,

5612,Old Tabby Links,"Old Tabby Links golf course, which opened in 1993, epitomizes Spring Island's nature-first philosophy.The front nine of this Arnold Palmer golf course weaves through a 150-year-old live oak forest. The back nine presents a totally different look. The first six holes meander through what used to be quail-hunting pastures. The last three border the marsh and present magnificent views of the Chechessee River, with the Broad River, Parris Island and Port Royal off on the horizon.Thoughtfully shaped to respect its natural surroundings, the golf course is distinguished not only by its playability but also by for its respect to its natural surroundings. Neither a home nor another fairway can be seen from many of the holes. Old Tabby Links measures 7,135 yards from the longest tees for a par of 72.The 17th hole, a beautiful and treacherous waterside par-3, is the course's signature hole.

It has a challenging but playable design that will appeal to players of all skill levels. Four different sets of tees make it even more accommodating. Water is a prominent feature of the course but there are strategically placed sand traps to contend with as well. The narrow fairways also demand accuracy. Water comes into play most notably on the signature 13th hole. This tricky par 3 has an island green that forces golfers to think creatively.

5632,Riverchase Golf Club,"One of Jim Fazio’s first solo projects, Riverchase is a surprisingly tough challenge given its lack of trees and relatively short length. The course runs through the bottomlands of the Elm Fork Trinity River and is loaded with water due to a chain of interconnecting lakes created to collect heavy rains and irrigate the course. While there are no forced carries, water comes into play at least 12 holes, and out-of-bounds is a frequent concern because of the housing community that surrounds the course.No. 5 is the most difficult rated hole–a long dogleg right par 4 that requires a solid tee shot to be in position to reach the green in two. The approach is long and uphill into a severely back-to-front sloping green with a lake on the right and out-of-bounds and bunkers on the left.Two holes later, No. 7 is one of the toughest approaches in all of DFW. This hole plays due south into the prevailing wind, and the elevated green has a depth of only about 25 feet. Bunkers line the back, and the slope in front is significant. Ups and downs are difficult because of the slopes in the green. Take a look at the pin placement when you’re teeing off on No. 4.The good news is that other than out-of-bounds, the course is mostly wide open, so you’ll generally have a shot if you just miss the fairway. The only thick spot for trees is along the creek on holes 14-16.Getting there : Take the Belt Line exit off of 635 and drive north to MacArthur. Turn right (east) and drive to Riverchase Dr., where you’ll turn left. Look for the course on the right side of the road.",https://www.riverchasegc.com/,,,,,,

Wide-open fairways lure you to use your driver off the tee, and drives that find the firm fairways will roll more than usual, setting up a short iron for the approach.

5662,Thorntree Country Club,"Thorntree opened in 1984, and while it has changed ownership multiple times over the years,it remains one of the toughest courses in the DFW area. The course features six lakes and three spring-fed creeks that spice up the layout, as well as immaculate fairways and challenging bent-grass greens.On the front, No. 5 stands out as one of the most difficult holes – a 400 yard-plus par 4 that runs through a chute of trees and doglegs right into a green sided by a pond.The back is a bit more difficult, which you’ll realize quickly due to the 666-yard double dogleg No. 10. The next hole is only a 382- yard par 4, but the approach is dicey into the shallow green. No. 13 is another nice hole–only 338 yards with another challenging approach into a green that’s guarded by an old thorn tree.Getting there : From I-35 south, take the Wintergreen Road exit and turn right.

This takes you back towards the south to Fort Worth for 6 miles, where you’ll take the Robson Ranch exit. Drive 1.5 miles west and look for the course.",https://www.robsonranchgolfclub.com/,,,,,,
5666,Yoakum County Golf Club,"Located between Denver City and Plains, Yoakum County is a wide-open course that was built on moderately rolling terrain. Water hazards (ponds, lakes, creeks, and streams) come into play on over half the holes, which is surprising for a course in this region. Avoid the driver if you can, as the course is short enough to score well without it. (You might need the driver, though, on the number-one handicap, a 440-yard, par 4 No. 14.)Watch for storms blowing in quickly on hot, summer afternoons. The course gained a few moments of fame one recent June when newscasts captured winds upwards of 100 MPH that took out whole trees and blew roofs off buildings.Getting there : From Lubbock drive through Brownfield; 12 miles south is Wellman.

Turn left at the stop sign and button-hook back through the park.",https://www.yoakumcountygolf.com/,,,,,,
5667,Underwood Golf Complex(Sunrise Course at Underwood Golf Complex ),"Sunrise opened in April of 1995, bringing a more modern layout to the Underwood facility. Ken Dye (Painted Dunes) built the course as sort of a Scottish links/desert-style track with undulating fairways and a multitude of water hazards. Quite a bit of dirt was moved to sculpt the flat terrain.On the front No. 5 stands out because it plays as a 465-yard par 4, but No. 9 is the most difficult because of its even greater length-a 587-yard par 5. Holes of note on the back are the 302-yard No. 11, which offers a great chance for birdie; another long par 4 in No. 13 (452 yards); and the mean 18th, a 441-yard dogleg right.Getting there : Located off I-10 and Gateway. From I-10 east, take US Hwy. 54 north and exit Ellerthorpe. Turn right and drive down the road into the housing development, where you will eventually see the clubhouse.",https://bliss.armymwr.com/programs/underwood-golf-complex,,,,,,
5668,Vista Hills Country Club,"Vista Hills is a private track built by Bruce Devlin and Robert von Hagge in 1974. This is a fairly long, desert-style course that winds through a residential subdivision with out-of-bounds lining narrow fairways on many holes. Some holes have slight elevation changes and can leave you with uneven lies.Hole 4 offers a nice touch: a 384-yard par 4 with an outstanding view of El Paso and Mexico. The long No. 17 has out-of-bounds on either side of the fairway, and a water hazard 100 yards out from the green. At 450 yards even a big drive leaves you with a long approach. The 13th hole is only 307 yards and doglegs right, which tempts you to cut the corner over the apartments.Getting there : Take the Lee Trevino exit off of I-10.

The course has a classic design that is player friendly enough for beginners and even gentle enough juniors. It may not be what you're looking for if you want a formidable test, but more advanced players will appreciate it for a quick casual round. It's also great for working on your short game skills. The golf course is short and tight with immaculately manicured greens. You won't find much water at Woodhaven Country Club except on the 17th, which seems like its nearly all water.",https://www.woodhavencc.com/,,,,,,
5677,Stonebriar Country Club,"Located at what for now is the end of the north-bound Dallas Tollway is the Stonebriar's Fazio Course, 30 minutes from downtown Dallas and an ideal business or resort getaway because of its convenient location near the generally fast moving north-south thoroughfare. And in addition to the hotel-business conference amenities, there’s the spectacular Tom Fazio route awaiting that is open for play only to resort guests and members of the adjoining Stonebriar Country Club.This place embodies Dallas’ northward surge. In the 1960s and 1970s, the new construction was further south in Richardson and Plano, when places like Preston Trails defined the suburbs’ northern edge. However, these days the edge is up this way in Frisco. On this once-barren, extremely flat farmland that served primarily as a hayfield lies the still reasonably flat Fazio track (although he moved over 600,000 yards of earth during construction) that is famous for its lightning-fast, Augusta-like putting surfaces. Made up of the new heat-resistant A-4 bentgrass that was installed recently at Fort Worth’s Colonial Country Club, these babies are certain three-jacks if you fail to pay attention to the pin placements with your approach.The greens are the signature at the Stonebriar, since Fazio’s layout is surprisingly hacker-friendly, mostly void of forced carries with fairways framed by mounds that seem to push the ball back into the fairway. The mounding also has a pleasing aesthetic purpose, making it impossible to see the neighboring fairways and greens.The best hole on the front is No. 2, a 407-yard doglegger that tees uphill over a wetland and involves an approach over a creek into a bunker-guarded green.On the back Fazio dropped in a 5-acre lake that comes into play on Nos. 11 and 14, both 400-yard-plus par 4s. Bunkers line the fairway on No. 11, and the hole doglegs right against the wind. Besides the lake on No. 14, the deep, multi-level green is the problem most likely to drive your score up.Getting there : From Hwy. 121 north, take the Legacy Ave. exit and west. The clubhouse is on the left side of the street.",https://www.invitedclubs.com/clubs/stonebriar-country-club,,,,,,
5678,"Trails of Frisco Golf Club, The","The Trails of Frisco golf course is one of Jeff Brauer’s most unique designs -- primarily because it doesn’t fit the mold of his other courses. Brauer, who’s known for his open, straight-forward courses, designed this one to tip out to a par 71, 6,900 yards, loaded it with hidden creeks, scenic wetlands, extensive bunkering, and massive greens. In fact, first-timers will be confused here. They’ll face intimidating views off the tee that leave doubt as to the problems that loom ahead, and it is definitely possible to lose all of your balls off the tee if you’re struggling.The golf course is just flat-out challenging, especially on the front nine. No. 1 opens up with a creek on the left that cuts in front of the green and generally makes its presence known on every shot. The play here is to stay right and stay away from its subtle presence on the left side. The creek comes into play on Nos. 2, 4, 5, and even No. 9, where it chutes from the fairway in front of the green and surrounds the green of this challenging par 4.All told, water and waste areas are in play on 16 of 18 holes (including every par 3), and the creeks are enhanced by visible lakes and ponds on the back side, even though it is considered a bit easier than the front.",https://www.thetrailsoffriscogc.com/,,,,,,
5679,Weston Lakes Country Club,"The tiny town of Fulshear offers an impressive, Carlton Gipson/Hale Irwin-designed golf course for its membership. Ancient pecans line the fairways, and an extensive system of lakes sets the landscape for this long, difficult course. Out-of-bounds lines many holes, and frequent windy conditions make it a challenging task to keep the ball in play.The front nine is highlighted by the mammoth 591-yard, par 5 8th hole, which starts the toughest stretch of golf around the turn. In fact, the top three most difficult rated holes encompass holes 8-10. No. 9 plays 412 yards into the clubhouse, followed by the unwelcome 453-yard par 4 No. 10 after your beer and hot dog at the turn.Getting there : From I-10 west, take the FM 359 exit and drive south. Head west on FM 1093 and drive 2 miles to the course where you'll see the clubhouse on the left side of the road.",https://www.westonlakes.net/,,,,,,
5681,White Wing Golf Club,"White Wing Golf Club opened its first opened with nine holes in June of 2000, and followed shortly thereafter with the complete package. Often compared to the nearby 1996 Legacy Hills, White Wing isn't quite as long, but is definitely more narrow, lined with massive old oak trees, some of which are located right in the middle of the fairway. Many times even if you pure the tee shot down the middle, you'll be forced to hustle a punch shot under one of these majestic trees.Billy Casper's design is known for its challenging par 5s, one of which is the signature finishing hole. No. 18 plays downhill into a split fairway, offering a more aggressive shot to the right that must clear Berry Creek at 210 yards out, which gives you the chance to get home in two. If you play it left, you'll need three good shots to get to the green, one of which will involve dealing with one of the huge oaks that looms in the fairway.White Wing Golf Club's most difficult hole is the par-4 No. 4, which requires an accurate tee shot between fairway bunkers, followed by an approach over a bunker into a multi-level green",https://www.whitewinggolf.com/,,,,,,
5686,Sunshine Country Club Estates,"Sunshine is a private course located in a retirement community that has been open for about 20 years. Of the par 3 courses in the Valley, this is considered one of the best. The course lays out over flat terrain and several lakes come into play, making water hazards the most prominent cause of difficulty.The course wanders through the housing community with a few trees spread throughout the course. Six of the nine holes have water, which is dyed blue for aesthetics. The greens are large and elevated, and grass berms are incorporated into the design to add character.The most difficult hole is No. 9, mainly because it is the longest at 161 yards. Also, there's water to the right and behind the green, as well as a large tree beside the lake that catches errant shots. The best birdie opportunity is No. 8.Other notes: There is no formal pro shop. Guest fees are voluntary and there is a box to slip the payment in.Getting there : From McAllen, take Hwy 83 east to Hwy 77. Turn north and drive 3 miles to the course.

Built on rolling terrain, the wide fairways present nice targets off the tee, and the elevated greens require taking an extra club every now and then. While not an overbearing factor, water hazards come into play throughout the design.Getting there : From Hwy 77 driving south, exit on Ed Carey and turn left. When you come to Business 77 turn right, drive down to Trailer Hills Blvd. and turn left. Veer right at the split in the road and turn left on Pinehurst, where you'll see signs to the course.",http://treasurehillsgolfclub.com/,,,,,,
5690,Tangle Oaks Golf Club,"Former Haskell Country Club superintendent Mark Bailey and his wife Gayle first broke ground for this course northeast of Hawley on New Year’s Day, 1996. Two and half years later, the original nine holes opened. Construction on the next nine wrapped up in 2002, leaving 18 outstanding holes for the public.Tangle Oaks is an appropriate name. The course is carved out of an extremely dense oak thicket, sometimes referred to as “the shinnery.” In fact, the shinnery is so thick that it’s played as a lateral hazard– players just drop from where the ball went into the briar-patch-like rough. Length is not imperative, but accuracy is key. The greens are elevated, tilt from back to front, and have a medium to high slope.The fairways are quite tight, due to the oaks. The strategy is simple. Keep it straight or you'll get in trouble. Length is not important, but accuracy is a must.The signature hole is No. 9, a 383-yard par 4 that plays into the teeth of the stiff west Texas wind. To further a golfer's sheer terror, the green is completely fronted by water and a formidable retaining wall. On the back the most notable hole is No. 13, which features an island green. Hole 18 is unique because of the split fairway.Other notes: The county is dry, but Tangle Oaks allows you to bring your own beer. While most of the play comes from Abilene, many visiting hunters chase game afield early in the morning, then play golf in the afternoon.Getting there : Call the course for more detailed directions, as they may be able to give you a better feel for finding this out-of-the-way course. From Abilene, drive north on Hwy 277 to Hawley. Go east at Exit 1226, and drive 6 miles to the course.",,,,,,,
5691,Texaco Country Club,"Originally opened as a 9-holer in 1924 for the Texas Co., TCC is the oldest existing private course in Houston that is still in its current location. Another nine was added in 1938, creating the full golf experience with a design that incorporated the unusual Cypress Pond. The pond is loaded with lily pads and cypress trees, which complements this traditional track quite well. The greens are small and undulating-difficult targets but fairly reasonable two-putts.No. 11 is the toughest hole at 563 yards. Considered one of the best holes in the Houston area, it's a double dogleg that has lots of trees and Greens Bayou to boot.Getting there : From I-10 going east, get off at the Federal Rd. exit and make a left.

Considered a shotmaker's course, this layout features over 100 bunkers and requires precise play throughout.Holes of note are the intimidating opening hole-a long, bending par 4 with a lake guarding the right side. Beware of the pin placement on this multi-tiered green. No. 8 is a 429-yard par 4 that requires a long drive and perfect approach because of the channel that guards the tiny, bunker-loaded green. On the back No. 14 is the best, dominated by a large lake in the fairway. At 444 yards it also requires a challengingly long approach into a small green.Getting there : From U.S. Hwy. 59 north, take the FM 1960 exit and go east for 8 miles to the course.

No. 9 is the most challenging, a 447-yard par 4 lined on the left by the bayou. It features an approach over a lake that fronts the green.Getting there : From I-10 west, take the Fry Rd. exit and turn left.

This famous spot is now home to the unforgettable 589-yard double dogleg, which rounds out the impressive stretch of par 5 holes that make up Nos. 9-11.More about No. 11: A draw is preferable off the tee, avoiding the trees and out-of-bounds that guard the left side. The key second shot should be a fairway wood left, avoiding Lake Conroe that comes into play on the right. If that shot is solid you'll face a 120-150 yard approach over the lake to a green that slopes back to front. Watch the wind and don't be afraid to take a bogey, as this is one of the finest, most difficult holes in Texas.Getting there : From I-45 north, take Hwy. 105 ( Exit 87) and head west.

The short design features generous fairways and prominent bunkering around the undulating greens. Lakes and ponds have been added over the years and impact play on most holes. Trees have also been added over the years to spice up the flat, prairie-like course.No. 9 is one of the toughest holes, a 440-yard par 4 that doglegs and has water.

5734,Woodlawn Country Club,"Once frequented by long-time pro Miller Barber, this old traditional track offers no real surprises on its rolling, tree-lined fairways. Water is in play on only a few holes, one of which is the 136-yard signature–a fun hole because of the peninsula green surrounded by water. The only par 5 plays 495 yards, but there are two 400-yard-plus par 4s on this 6,405-yard, par 71 layout.Getting there : From Dallas, take Hwy. 75 north for 75 miles, then take Exit 65.

5741,Spur Golf Course,"Only the basics here at this 9-hole municipal course built in the rugged country of the Salt Fork of the Brazos. This is a natural course, with mounding that results from the contour of the land. While passing through town, we decided that this facility is perfect for the beginner. There are no water hazards or bunkers; furthermore, there is no pressure because there are no people. Teach your wife to play here–her shots will roll forever because the fairways are not watered.Getting there : In town find the Allsup Convenience Store, turn left, and the course is over the hill.",,,,,,,
5742,Stamford Golf & Country Club,"Built in the 1930s, Stamford GCC is known as the place where former Masters champion Charles Coody learned his game. The fairways are flat and lined with trees, and the landing areas are generous. A new irrigation system was installed in the 1990s which makes the conditions more favorable. This scenic course is a pleasure to walk, fortunately–walking is mandatory because there are no carts. The only par 4 over 400 yards is No. 8, which is the number one handicap. The par 4 No. 4 hole is only 270 yards.Getting there : From Fort Worth take Hwy 6 down to Wells St. Turn left and drive straight to the course.",https://www.facebook.com/StamfordGolfCountryClub/,,,,,,
5744,Stratford Country Club,"The history of Stratford Country Club dates back to 1896 when William Maynard, one of the club's shareholders, began golfing in the open field north of the Avon River where nine golf holes were built 20 years later. An additional nine were designed in 1970, creating the 18-hole golf course that exists today. Given the course's age, there are mature trees covering the landscape. Its riverside location guarantees water on a few holes and there are strategically placed bunkers throughout. There is also the occasional multi-tiered green to watch out for. Stratford Country Club is visually intimidating, and it does offer some challenges, but it is actually quite accessible for most skill levels.",https://stratfordcountryclub.ca/,,,,,,
