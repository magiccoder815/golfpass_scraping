6168,Stonebridge Golf Club,"Stonebridge Golf Club is an Arthur Hills design that is one of southeast Michigan's best kept secrets. The championship layout incorporates the plentiful water and woods of the natural terrain. The white sand bunkers that are strategically placed throughout add a beautiful contrast to the lush green of the golf course. The undulating terrain is one of the layout's most prominent features. Elaborate hills and greenside swales protect many of the putting complexes. The putting surfaces on the front nine are relatively calm when compared to the back nine where most of the greens are double-tiered, ridged, or layered. The par-4 15th is one of Stonebridge Golf Club's most scenic and challenging holes. With water in front, back, and right of the green, this is one of the toughest approaches on the back nine.",https://stonebridgegolfclub.net/,,,,,,
6170,Riverside Golf Course,"Riverside Golf Course is located on the northwest side of Janesville near the Rock River. Opened in 1924, it is one of the oldest courses in the area and over the years it has earned the reputation of being one of southern Wisconsin's best public courses. The course has also been recognized as one of the 50 best public golf values in the country. The gently rolling hills of the landscape provide the course with rolling, tree-lined fairways and large, undulating greens, which are framed by strategically placed bunkers. Riverside is a challenging course but not so difficult that beginners should be intimidated. The classic layout is quite forgiving and versatile enough for a range of skill levels, one reason why it is the host to the Ray Fischer Tournament, one of the Midwest's most prestigious amateur events.",https://www.janesvilleriverside.com/,,,,,,

6239,Wolf Creek Golf Resort,"Tucked away in a small mountain valley on the eastern side of Ogden's Wasatch Mountains is one of the best courses in the state. It is scenic, challenging, well maintained and isn't as busy as most courses in Northern Utah.The reason that the course is not as busy is that it is a little more than an hour away from Salt Lake City and there isn't an Interstate running to it. But with the highway construction happening now in the city you can probably drive to Wolf Creek faster than you can across town.Wolf Creek is located in the rolling hills just below the canyon that leads to the Powder Mountain Ski Resort. The high mountains surround everything in sight and the area is very scenic. In addition to the golf course Wolf Creek includes condos and time share units for summer and winter vacationers.The course is a mountain style course with elevated tees, sloped terrain and lots of wild areas in which to lose your ball. Wildlife is often seen on the course including deer, moose and fox. A more common critter on the course is the garter snake. They are harmless but can give you a scare if you disturb one hiding hiding in the long grass.Wolf Creek is probably one of the top five toughest courses in Utah. It's tough because of it's playing length, not it's actual length. On the card, the tee lengths of 6845 (gold) and 6465 (blue) don't seem to be outrageous, but the way the holes use the yardage will make you think a 300 yard drive is required to score well.Several of the toughest par 4 holes in Utah are on Wolf Creek. Numbers 3, 7 and 18 are well over 400 yards long and each has an up sloping fairway to an elevated green. Long uphill second shots put fairway woods into the hands of all but the longest players. And once you reach the greens in regulation you still have to putt out on fast greens that break severely toward the valley bottom.Other long holes include the par 3s. All but one of them is in the 180+ range and two of them have long carries over water. The par 5s are the most manageable holes but even they have elevated greens making the holes play longer.The fairways are generally wider on the holes that require long tee shots, but all holes have plenty of places that provide lost and unplayable lies. The front 9 seems to be wide open as there are very few trees, but the long meadow grasses off the fairways will hide a ball as well as the thick woods on the back 9.Be cautious when driving from the elevated tees. Since the ball flies further after being hit from high above the landing area, the distance a miss-hit shot draws or fades will be exaggerated and you could end up missing the fairway. This is especially true on holes 1 and 10.Wolf Creek Golf Course is a tough challenge for the best golfers without being overly penal for mid handicap golfers. Beginners may find it over powering. Although the green fees are about $5 more than the average public course, Wolf Creek Golf resort offers a great value for the experienced golfer.",http://www.wolfcreekgolfutah.com/,,,,,,
6240,Oakridge Country Club,"The golf course at Oakridge Country Club, located between Salt Lake and Ogden, has a traditional layout with many mature oak trees that can greatly affect the game. The tight course is an interesting mix of par 3s and par 4s with some par 5s thrown in as well. There are some water hazards that come into play in the form of a lake and bunkers protect several of the greens. Long, straight shots are needed to do well at Oakridge Country Club. There are five sets of tee boxes on the golf course to provide different options and to adapt the game to different skill levels.",https://www.oakridgecc.com/,,,,,,

Although there is no water, there are narrow fairways that have at least one tree that can greatly affect shots, which make the course quite difficult in some aspects. The course is surprisingly lengthy, adding to its difficulty. There are also several strategically placed bunkers situated throughout. The golf course features three sets of tee boxes to accommodate a wide range of skill levels and abilities. Copper Golf Club also boasts practice facilities including a putting green and chipping area.",https://www.coppergolfclub.com/,,,,,,

It features difficult fairways that are scattered with pines, aspen trees, and low brush and nearly all of them are bunkered and heavily sloped. The greens are medium to large in size and are well protected by bunkers. East Canyon Creek runs through the golf course and it is often used as a water hazards on many holes.
