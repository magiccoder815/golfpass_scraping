""The cabbage is grown thick in the summer months, consisting of a deadly blend of Bermuda around the greens and Bahia along the fairways.""Arthur Hills can be notorious for creating difficult courses like his course at Palmetto Hall. This course really demands accuracy or you can put some big numbers on your scorecard.""Playing the forward tees will give resort golfers enough of a challenge to keep them happy, while better golfers will be heavily challenged from the tips, which play nearly 7,000 yards, with a slope of 136.",https://hiltonheadgolf.net/clubs/palmetto-hall,,,,,,

The headliner of five 18-hole courses at Kiawah Island Resort, the Ocean Course was designed by architect Pete Dye and opened in 1991, just prior to its staging of the 1991 Ryder Cup, otherwise known as the “War by the Shore.” It also hosted the 2012 PGA Championship, won by Rory McIlroy, and the 2021 PGA Championship. The Ocean Course is a windswept coastal layout that plays along a narrow and sandy section on the east end of the island. Its defenses are numerous, from small, elevated greens to huge waste areas that surround plateaued fairways. New tees installed prior to the 2021 PGA Championship can stretch the layout to over 7,800 yards. For daily resort play, the Ocean Course is a walking-only layout that comes with caddies, with the exception of summer months after 10 a.m., when carts are permitted. It has been ranked within the Top 5 public golf courses in the country according to top magazine panels. Elevating the experience further is an oceanside driving range and putting green, as well as its iconic, lowcountry-inspired Ocean Course clubhouse, designed by Robert A.M. Stern architects. The 24,000-square-foot building features the Ryder Cup bar for casual dining and drinks as well as The Atlantic Room for fine dining. In 2021, Kiawah Island added four Ocean Course Cottages, each four-bedroom, 3,800-square-foot units that overlook the course.

The golf course put into effect a successful environmental strategy that has resulted in a sizeable increase in wildlife and wildflowers. More than 9,000 trees were planted prior to construction of the course and there is minimal, if any, use of pesticides. The sound environmental and maintenance systems in combination with the dry, free-draining site ensure that the golf course is playable year-round. The layout has a nice variety of holes including lengthy par 5s, tricky par 3s, and par 4s that offer birdie opportunities. Elmwood Golf Club also offers an expansive driving range with both indoor and outdoor bays.",https://www.elmwoodgolf.co.uk/,,,,,,

It offers two 18-hole golf courses and one nine-hole course. Dick Wilson originally designed the Blue Course in 1958, but in 2004 Rees Jones did a complete renovation. Jones reshaped all of the course's greens, creating several with multiple tiers, and he also rebuilt many of the tees, which are all now square. The fairways and greenside bunkers were completely reconstructed as well to provide a greater challenge. The signature hole is the par-4 16th, which poses a formidable threat since it plays right into prevailing wind. The 14th is also memorable for its treacherous water hazard.",https://rmgc.org/,,,,,,

The aptly chosen name translates to 'giant,' referencing the stunning cliffs surrounding the course. The layout is comprised of multiple levels of plateaus that offer panoramic view of the boreal forest and meandering streams that cover the landscape. The golf course is one of two at the resort, the other being Le Diable, or the Devil. While the other course may draw inspiration from it, Le Geant is definitely a more difficult challenge. Although it is shorter, every component of its layout including the numerous sand bunkers, were meticulously placed to provide the greatest challenge.",https://www.tremblant.ca/,,,,,,
8178,Le Chateau Montebello,"Neighbor to the Laurentian Mountains, the Fairmont Le Chateau Montebello Golf Club tumbles across a dramatic, rolling landscape. The course tightly winds through towering forests, which not only provides some challenging holes but also ensures a secluded, closed-in feel. Originally designed by Stanley Thompson in 1929, it has become one of the most popular golf courses in Quebec. In 1998, the scenic course was designated as an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary. The layout is considered one of the toughest in the province. The elevation changes throughout the course offer scenic mountain views but they also guarantee that a flat lie will be hard to find. There are a few water hazards on the golf course but the challenge comes mostly from the well guarded greens. In addition to the course, there is also a driving range and chipping and putting greens.",https://www.fairmont.com/montebello/golf/montebello-golf-course/,,,,,,

It is not often played or heard of because the club is reputed to be one of the most exclusive in the country. The golf course is laid across the east slope of Mount Bruno. The tree-lined fairways and heavily bunkered greens carefully follow the natural undulation of the landscape, featuring a good amount of elevation changes that often cause the ball the break in a different direction than what you're expecting. Mount Bruno's signature hole is the par-4 13th, which sits at the highest point on the course, offering a spectacular view of the surrounding valley. The tee shot plays downhill and then requires an uphill approach to an elevated green that slopes to the left and is flanked by bunkers on the right.",https://secure.gggolf.ca/mountbruno/index.php?lang=en,,,,,,

The front nine of the course features narrow, tree-lined fairways and challenging greens that are difficult to read. Right away, golfers are forced to choose accuracy over distance since straying from the fairways could result in an extremely difficult lie. Golfers will be able to make up for this on the back nine where long hitters have the opportunity to showcase their skills. These holes open up a bit more and feature wider fairways.

The front nine has numerous water hazards and plays a bit longer than the back nine due to a handful of lengthy par 5s.

Duntroon Highlands Golf Club's fairways are fairly wide and there are trees bordering some. The hilly terrain provides some undulation in the greens, which are fast and vary in size. The golf course begins with scenic views but as it moves towards lowland forest on the back nine, the layout becomes considerably more challenging.

8512,Fairview Golf & Country Club,"Heritage Ranch serves up an especially challenging par 72, 6,988-yard Arthur Hills design that rolls through the oaks and pecans just outside of Fairview. And while it’s part of a gated, active-adult residential community, the course is open to the public and especially fun because it integrates well with the neighborhood. Houses line some fairways, but a fair number of holes provide that natural, rural feel that is always so welcome on a golf course.While the course is not particularly demanding off the tees, the real challenge at Heritage Ranch comes from the mound-shaped greens. If your irons aren’t dialed in, you’ll be working hard for ups and downs.No. 1 is a unique opener because it bends left down to a fairway and green that aren’t visible from the tee. Big drives can get close, but the recommended play is to take a long iron and draw it over the hill.The par 5s on the front are nice holes. No. 3 doglegs right and requires a good tee shot, followed by a relatively easy second shot into a widening fairway toward the hole. The trick is nailing the short iron (almost a blind shot) into the elevated green guarded by bunkers on the front. No. 7 is longer and offers a good chance for birdie, again because of its wide-open nature.No. 16 is the signature hole: a par 3 masterpiece that plays along a natural spring waterfall. You’ll need to nail a long iron over the valley and avoid the trees that overhang the fairway from the right.No. 18 is a good finisher–it’s a long par 4 that doglegs left around a few large fairway bunkers, then works its way uphill to an elevated, mound-shaped green surrounded by bunkers. Ups and downs are possible here if you miss the green back left, which is easy to do when you approach with a fairway wood.Getting there : Only 20 miles northeast of Dallas, take I-75 north to the Stacy Road exit, then turn right and drive to the dead end. The road jogs to the left, then right, and continues as Stacy Road. The entrance is 2 miles down on the left.",https://www.heritageranchgolf.com/,,,,,,

Don't let the scenic tranquility or the length of the layout fool you though, the layout offers a formidable round. The most challenging feature of the golf course lies in the size of the small greens, which demand accuracy on the approach.

Sprawling across a lush landscape blanketed with century-old oaks and towering pines, the layout is as scenic as it is challenging. While the generous fairways may be player friendly, the difficult approaches to the elevated, well bunkered greens are anything but. The large, pristine white sand bunkers were designed in true Palmer-style, closely following the natural undulations of the land. The gently rolling terrain is unique for the area.

Water is a prominent feature of the course but there are strategically placed sand traps to contend with as well. The narrow fairways also demand accuracy.

5632,Riverchase Golf Club,"One of Jim Fazio’s first solo projects, Riverchase is a surprisingly tough challenge given its lack of trees and relatively short length. The course runs through the bottomlands of the Elm Fork Trinity River and is loaded with water due to a chain of interconnecting lakes created to collect heavy rains and irrigate the course. While there are no forced carries, water comes into play at least 12 holes, and out-of-bounds is a frequent concern because of the housing community that surrounds the course.No. 5 is the most difficult rated hole–a long dogleg right par 4 that requires a solid tee shot to be in position to reach the green in two. The approach is long and uphill into a severely back-to-front sloping green with a lake on the right and out-of-bounds and bunkers on the left.Two holes later, No. 7 is one of the toughest approaches in all of DFW. This hole plays due south into the prevailing wind, and the elevated green has a depth of only about 25 feet. Bunkers line the back, and the slope in front is significant. Ups and downs are difficult because of the slopes in the green. Take a look at the pin placement when you’re teeing off on No. 4.The good news is that other than out-of-bounds, the course is mostly wide open, so you’ll generally have a shot if you just miss the fairway. The only thick spot for trees is along the creek on holes 14-16.Getting there : Take the Belt Line exit off of 635 and drive north to MacArthur.

The next hole is only a 382- yard par 4, but the approach is dicey into the shallow green. No. 13 is another nice hole–only 338 yards with another challenging approach into a green that’s guarded by an old thorn tree.Getting there : From I-35 south, take the Wintergreen Road exit and turn right.

Avoid the driver if you can, as the course is short enough to score well without it. (You might need the driver, though, on the number-one handicap, a 440-yard, par 4 No. 14.)Watch for storms blowing in quickly on hot, summer afternoons.

Quite a bit of dirt was moved to sculpt the flat terrain.On the front No. 5 stands out because it plays as a 465-yard par 4, but No. 9 is the most difficult because of its even greater length-a 587-yard par 5. Holes of note on the back are the 302-yard No. 11, which offers a great chance for birdie; another long par 4 in No. 13 (452 yards); and the mean 18th, a 441-yard dogleg right.Getting there : Located off I-10 and Gateway.

The long No. 17 has out-of-bounds on either side of the fairway, and a water hazard 100 yards out from the green. At 450 yards even a big drive leaves you with a long approach. The 13th hole is only 307 yards and doglegs right, which tempts you to cut the corner over the apartments.Getting there : Take the Lee Trevino exit off of I-10.

5677,Stonebriar Country Club,"Located at what for now is the end of the north-bound Dallas Tollway is the Stonebriar's Fazio Course, 30 minutes from downtown Dallas and an ideal business or resort getaway because of its convenient location near the generally fast moving north-south thoroughfare. And in addition to the hotel-business conference amenities, there’s the spectacular Tom Fazio route awaiting that is open for play only to resort guests and members of the adjoining Stonebriar Country Club.This place embodies Dallas’ northward surge. In the 1960s and 1970s, the new construction was further south in Richardson and Plano, when places like Preston Trails defined the suburbs’ northern edge. However, these days the edge is up this way in Frisco. On this once-barren, extremely flat farmland that served primarily as a hayfield lies the still reasonably flat Fazio track (although he moved over 600,000 yards of earth during construction) that is famous for its lightning-fast, Augusta-like putting surfaces. Made up of the new heat-resistant A-4 bentgrass that was installed recently at Fort Worth’s Colonial Country Club, these babies are certain three-jacks if you fail to pay attention to the pin placements with your approach.The greens are the signature at the Stonebriar, since Fazio’s layout is surprisingly hacker-friendly, mostly void of forced carries with fairways framed by mounds that seem to push the ball back into the fairway. The mounding also has a pleasing aesthetic purpose, making it impossible to see the neighboring fairways and greens.The best hole on the front is No. 2, a 407-yard doglegger that tees uphill over a wetland and involves an approach over a creek into a bunker-guarded green.On the back Fazio dropped in a 5-acre lake that comes into play on Nos. 11 and 14, both 400-yard-plus par 4s. Bunkers line the fairway on No. 11, and the hole doglegs right against the wind. Besides the lake on No. 14, the deep, multi-level green is the problem most likely to drive your score up.Getting there : From Hwy. 121 north, take the Legacy Ave. exit and west. The clubhouse is on the left side of the street.",https://www.invitedclubs.com/clubs/stonebriar-country-club,,,,,,
5678,"Trails of Frisco Golf Club, The","The Trails of Frisco golf course is one of Jeff Brauer’s most unique designs -- primarily because it doesn’t fit the mold of his other courses. Brauer, who’s known for his open, straight-forward courses, designed this one to tip out to a par 71, 6,900 yards, loaded it with hidden creeks, scenic wetlands, extensive bunkering, and massive greens. In fact, first-timers will be confused here. They’ll face intimidating views off the tee that leave doubt as to the problems that loom ahead, and it is definitely possible to lose all of your balls off the tee if you’re struggling.The golf course is just flat-out challenging, especially on the front nine. No. 1 opens up with a creek on the left that cuts in front of the green and generally makes its presence known on every shot. The play here is to stay right and stay away from its subtle presence on the left side. The creek comes into play on Nos. 2, 4, 5, and even No. 9, where it chutes from the fairway in front of the green and surrounds the green of this challenging par 4.All told, water and waste areas are in play on 16 of 18 holes (including every par 3), and the creeks are enhanced by visible lakes and ponds on the back side, even though it is considered a bit easier than the front.",https://www.thetrailsoffriscogc.com/,,,,,,
5679,Weston Lakes Country Club,"The tiny town of Fulshear offers an impressive, Carlton Gipson/Hale Irwin-designed golf course for its membership. Ancient pecans line the fairways, and an extensive system of lakes sets the landscape for this long, difficult course. Out-of-bounds lines many holes, and frequent windy conditions make it a challenging task to keep the ball in play.The front nine is highlighted by the mammoth 591-yard, par 5 8th hole, which starts the toughest stretch of golf around the turn. In fact, the top three most difficult rated holes encompass holes 8-10. No. 9 plays 412 yards into the clubhouse, followed by the unwelcome 453-yard par 4 No. 10 after your beer and hot dog at the turn.Getting there : From I-10 west, take the FM 359 exit and drive south. Head west on FM 1093 and drive 2 miles to the course where you'll see the clubhouse on the left side of the road.",https://www.westonlakes.net/,,,,,,
5681,White Wing Golf Club,"White Wing Golf Club opened its first opened with nine holes in June of 2000, and followed shortly thereafter with the complete package. Often compared to the nearby 1996 Legacy Hills, White Wing isn't quite as long, but is definitely more narrow, lined with massive old oak trees, some of which are located right in the middle of the fairway. Many times even if you pure the tee shot down the middle, you'll be forced to hustle a punch shot under one of these majestic trees.Billy Casper's design is known for its challenging par 5s, one of which is the signature finishing hole. No. 18 plays downhill into a split fairway, offering a more aggressive shot to the right that must clear Berry Creek at 210 yards out, which gives you the chance to get home in two. If you play it left, you'll need three good shots to get to the green, one of which will involve dealing with one of the huge oaks that looms in the fairway.White Wing Golf Club's most difficult hole is the par-4 No. 4, which requires an accurate tee shot between fairway bunkers, followed by an approach over a bunker into a multi-level green",https://www.whitewinggolf.com/,,,,,,
5686,Sunshine Country Club Estates,"Sunshine is a private course located in a retirement community that has been open for about 20 years. Of the par 3 courses in the Valley, this is considered one of the best. The course lays out over flat terrain and several lakes come into play, making water hazards the most prominent cause of difficulty.The course wanders through the housing community with a few trees spread throughout the course. Six of the nine holes have water, which is dyed blue for aesthetics. The greens are large and elevated, and grass berms are incorporated into the design to add character.The most difficult hole is No. 9, mainly because it is the longest at 161 yards. Also, there's water to the right and behind the green, as well as a large tree beside the lake that catches errant shots. The best birdie opportunity is No. 8.Other notes: There is no formal pro shop. Guest fees are voluntary and there is a box to slip the payment in.Getting there : From McAllen, take Hwy 83 east to Hwy 77. Turn north and drive 3 miles to the course.

5690,Tangle Oaks Golf Club,"Former Haskell Country Club superintendent Mark Bailey and his wife Gayle first broke ground for this course northeast of Hawley on New Year’s Day, 1996. Two and half years later, the original nine holes opened. Construction on the next nine wrapped up in 2002, leaving 18 outstanding holes for the public.Tangle Oaks is an appropriate name. The course is carved out of an extremely dense oak thicket, sometimes referred to as “the shinnery.” In fact, the shinnery is so thick that it’s played as a lateral hazard– players just drop from where the ball went into the briar-patch-like rough. Length is not imperative, but accuracy is key. The greens are elevated, tilt from back to front, and have a medium to high slope.The fairways are quite tight, due to the oaks. The strategy is simple. Keep it straight or you'll get in trouble. Length is not important, but accuracy is a must.The signature hole is No. 9, a 383-yard par 4 that plays into the teeth of the stiff west Texas wind. To further a golfer's sheer terror, the green is completely fronted by water and a formidable retaining wall. On the back the most notable hole is No. 13, which features an island green. Hole 18 is unique because of the split fairway.Other notes: The county is dry, but Tangle Oaks allows you to bring your own beer. While most of the play comes from Abilene, many visiting hunters chase game afield early in the morning, then play golf in the afternoon.Getting there : Call the course for more detailed directions, as they may be able to give you a better feel for finding this out-of-the-way course. From Abilene, drive north on Hwy 277 to Hawley. Go east at Exit 1226, and drive 6 miles to the course.",,,,,,,
5691,Texaco Country Club,"Originally opened as a 9-holer in 1924 for the Texas Co., TCC is the oldest existing private course in Houston that is still in its current location. Another nine was added in 1938, creating the full golf experience with a design that incorporated the unusual Cypress Pond. The pond is loaded with lily pads and cypress trees, which complements this traditional track quite well. The greens are small and undulating-difficult targets but fairly reasonable two-putts.No. 11 is the toughest hole at 563 yards. Considered one of the best holes in the Houston area, it's a double dogleg that has lots of trees and Greens Bayou to boot.Getting there : From I-10 going east, get off at the Federal Rd. exit and make a left.

Considered a shotmaker's course, this layout features over 100 bunkers and requires precise play throughout.Holes of note are the intimidating opening hole-a long, bending par 4 with a lake guarding the right side. Beware of the pin placement on this multi-tiered green. No. 8 is a 429-yard par 4 that requires a long drive and perfect approach because of the channel that guards the tiny, bunker-loaded green. On the back No. 14 is the best, dominated by a large lake in the fairway. At 444 yards it also requires a challengingly long approach into a small green.Getting there : From U.S. Hwy. 59 north, take the FM 1960 exit and go east for 8 miles to the course.

5714,Walden on Lake Conroe Golf & Country Club,"Long considered the best course in the Houston area, Walden rolls through a spectacular setting on the southwest shores of Lake Conroe and offers one of the most memorable golf experiences in Texas.The course was designed by Robert von Hagge and Bruce Devlin, who moved over 300,000 cubic yards of earth to extend the lakefront property. This famous spot is now home to the unforgettable 589-yard double dogleg, which rounds out the impressive stretch of par 5 holes that make up Nos. 9-11.More about No. 11: A draw is preferable off the tee, avoiding the trees and out-of-bounds that guard the left side. The key second shot should be a fairway wood left, avoiding Lake Conroe that comes into play on the right. If that shot is solid you'll face a 120-150 yard approach over the lake to a green that slopes back to front. Watch the wind and don't be afraid to take a bogey, as this is one of the finest, most difficult holes in Texas.Getting there : From I-45 north, take Hwy. 105 ( Exit 87) and head west.

The short design features generous fairways and prominent bunkering around the undulating greens. Lakes and ponds have been added over the years and impact play on most holes. Trees have also been added over the years to spice up the flat, prairie-like course.No. 9 is one of the toughest holes, a 440-yard par 4 that doglegs and has water.

Not only are there birdie opportunities on the short par 4s, but all of the par 3s are under 200 yards, three of which should require no more than a medium-length iron.

The fairways are fairly generous, and most of the greens have deceptive undulations.During the round you’ll notice the long, challenging par 4s. Particularly the 405 yard No. 11, where a creek cuts into the fairway twice, framing the landing area off the tee. No. 3 is also tough, playing 446 yards and forcing another carry of a creek that cuts into the fairway. The 17th is another solid par 4–not as long, but picturesque because the green is completely surrounded by water.Finally, the feature that rounds out the experience at Wildflower is the great condition of the course, enhanced by the new irrigation system that keeps the fairways lush and the greens healthy and rolling true.Getting there : From I-35 north, exit Midway Drive and turn left.

5776,Wichita Falls Country Club,"Fred Cooper, a Scottish immigrant, failed to find a suitable place to pursue his passion for golf when he settled in Wichita Falls in the early 1900s. So in 1914, the Wichita Falls Golf Club was formed with a 9-hole course and clubhouse on Victory Street.The club prospered through the 1920s, then fell on hard times during the Depression and was eventually turned over to the mortgage company in 1935. After several attempts to reorganize the club, Solon Featherston bought the entire club, made many improvements (first bent-grass greens in North Texas), and brought the facility back to profitability–due in part to slot machines installed during his tenure.The layout features a good mixture of holes, with a creek winding its way through the course and coming into play on more than half of the holes. A small lake also impacts a few holes. The fairways are tree-lined and there is a moderate amount of bunkering. While some tee shots require the precision for target golf, others are wide-open and offer generous landing areas.In late 1994, holes 14 and 15 were renovated. Jeff Brauer and Ralph Plummer have done work here periodically over the years.Make note of Ladies Day on Thursdays, as only ladies may tee off until 11:00 AM.Getting there : From Hwy 287 north, turn right at Midwestern, then drive 2 miles to the course.

5777,Texas National Golf Club,"Referred to as “the best piece of land left in America close to a downtown” by architect Tom Fazio, ultra-exclusive Dallas National sets a new standard for golf in Dallas. Created with the aim of obtaining a major championship, the course opened in 2002 in an amazing spot just 6 miles southeast of downtown in old Oak Cliff.The land itself was once owned by a cement company that was unable to effectively use the land, and the city of Dallas refused to zone the area because of an escarpment that slices the landscape. Result: the perfect opportunity to use the terrain for golf. But this isn’t just your normal run-of-the-mill upscale daily-fee development. The big boys play here--guys like Tom Hicks and Roger Staubach--and the price tag is rumored to be upwards of $160,000 to become one of 350 members.The high price tag, Fazio name, superb location, and stunning landscape combine to make one of the highest-profile facilities that has ever graced the great state of Texas. Dallasites would be shocked to learn of the spectacular elevation changes that reside so close to their flat city. Tipping out at over 7,300 yards, the par 72 track spreads out over almost 400 acres of limestone canyons, winding creek beds, and large plateaus, with up to 160 feet of elevation changes.Every hole is a signature hole, with Fazio’s signature bunkers defining the immaculate zoysia fairways. The natural appearance of the course is accentuated by the subtle reddish-tan cart paths, and artistic wooden bridges span the limestone ravines. Many holes offer elevated tees and impressive views of the city.And while the USGA gave the course one of the highest slope ratings ever (155), which is sure to help the club attract a big-time tournament, wealthy hacks can enjoy themselves from one of the other six remaining sets of tees.Getting there : Just east of Loop 12 between Keeneland Pkwy. and Jefferson Blvd. south of I-30.",https://www.dallasnationalgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

With four sets of tees, the golf course is perfect for juniors and beginners who want some practice or avid golfers wanting a quick round. One of the most appealing things about Windcrest Golf Club is that it doesn't get especially crowded on weekends, meaning tee times are rarely required.",http://www.windcrestgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

Howard’s design involves a few blind tee shots that play uphill, as well as a few from elevated tees that offer good views of the holes ahead. Water comes into play on half the holes, and the large greens are of medium speed.No. 8 is the signature, playing 590 yards and requiring two tough shots down a swerving fairway lined by a lake. The approach is nasty because of the skinny green that is covered by trees.Getting there : From I-30 east towards Greenville, take Hwy. 34 north to FM 2358.

Couples clearly favors traditional golf designs, as this one is pure old-school. A whopping six sets of tees allow just about anyone to enjoy the game at this exclusive club.The front side features the most difficult rated hole-the 473-yard No. 7, which tees over water and involves a tricky approach into a green protected by water left and back. The fairway snakes on No. 7, which creates some deceptive angles from which to approach the hole.On the back, Couples mixed it up well by offering an easier stretch of golf on holes 13-16, which consist of two relatively short par 4s and a pair of reasonable par 3s.Getting there : Take Beltway 8 south from I-10 to Westheimer.

6239,Wolf Creek Golf Resort,"Tucked away in a small mountain valley on the eastern side of Ogden's Wasatch Mountains is one of the best courses in the state. It is scenic, challenging, well maintained and isn't as busy as most courses in Northern Utah.The reason that the course is not as busy is that it is a little more than an hour away from Salt Lake City and there isn't an Interstate running to it. But with the highway construction happening now in the city you can probably drive to Wolf Creek faster than you can across town.Wolf Creek is located in the rolling hills just below the canyon that leads to the Powder Mountain Ski Resort. The high mountains surround everything in sight and the area is very scenic. In addition to the golf course Wolf Creek includes condos and time share units for summer and winter vacationers.The course is a mountain style course with elevated tees, sloped terrain and lots of wild areas in which to lose your ball. Wildlife is often seen on the course including deer, moose and fox. A more common critter on the course is the garter snake. They are harmless but can give you a scare if you disturb one hiding hiding in the long grass.Wolf Creek is probably one of the top five toughest courses in Utah. It's tough because of it's playing length, not it's actual length. On the card, the tee lengths of 6845 (gold) and 6465 (blue) don't seem to be outrageous, but the way the holes use the yardage will make you think a 300 yard drive is required to score well.Several of the toughest par 4 holes in Utah are on Wolf Creek. Numbers 3, 7 and 18 are well over 400 yards long and each has an up sloping fairway to an elevated green. Long uphill second shots put fairway woods into the hands of all but the longest players. And once you reach the greens in regulation you still have to putt out on fast greens that break severely toward the valley bottom.Other long holes include the par 3s. All but one of them is in the 180+ range and two of them have long carries over water. The par 5s are the most manageable holes but even they have elevated greens making the holes play longer.The fairways are generally wider on the holes that require long tee shots, but all holes have plenty of places that provide lost and unplayable lies. The front 9 seems to be wide open as there are very few trees, but the long meadow grasses off the fairways will hide a ball as well as the thick woods on the back 9.Be cautious when driving from the elevated tees. Since the ball flies further after being hit from high above the landing area, the distance a miss-hit shot draws or fades will be exaggerated and you could end up missing the fairway. This is especially true on holes 1 and 10.Wolf Creek Golf Course is a tough challenge for the best golfers without being overly penal for mid handicap golfers. Beginners may find it over powering. Although the green fees are about $5 more than the average public course, Wolf Creek Golf resort offers a great value for the experienced golfer.",http://www.wolfcreekgolfutah.com/,,,,,,

Renowned architect Rees Jones designed the course. He incorporated the many natural features provided by the golf course's location in the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge. The fairways are edged with saltwater marshes and Jones included his signature sculpted bunkers along the greensides. Just a stone's throw from the ocean, the golf course is as scenic as it is challenging. The second hole is one of southeastern Virginia's toughest golf holes with out-of-bounds to the left, trees to the right, and a sloped fairway that leads to a well guarded, double-tiered green. This par 4 is the no. 1 handicap hole at When Hell's Point Golf Club.",https://www.hellspoint.com/,,,,,,

Built in 1922, the golf course is one of northwestern Wisconsin's premier courses. It has a traditional layout that sprawls across gently rolling hills though it is still a very walkable course. You'll find water coming into play on half of the 18 holes, along with tricky doglegs, forced carries, and a slew of strategically placed bunkers. The diverse landscape of woodlands, wetlands, and hills provide plenty of variety among each hole.

The golf course has a stunning natural setting that is also indicative of the rich history of Baraboo. The course is routed through carefully protected and preserved Indian burial mounds that are more than 1,000 years old. Draper creek ambles through the golf course, connecting Devil's Lake to the Baraboo River. It comes into play on half of the holes. The par-5 eighth is the course's signature. This tricky hole first requires a drive over water to a generous landing area before doglegging left to another landing area that is tightly lined with trees, water, and Indian mounds. Finally there is a blind shot to a sloping green that not only breaks severely from back to front but is also well protected by bunkers.",https://baraboocc.com/,,,,,,
6662,Beaver Dam Country Club,"Beaver Dam Country Club sits just a few miles from Horicon Marsh, the largest freshwater refuge in the U.S. The golf course originally opened as a nine-hole layout in the 1960s but now it is one of the area's most popular 18-hole courses. The layout has a traditional design with small, elevated greens and tree-lined fairways. It is on the shorter side at 6,000 yards, at least by today's standards, but it offers plenty of challenges even without having the length. Strategically placed bunkers lurk beside the greens and the rolling terrain guarantees some tricky lies. The third and eighth are two of Beaver Dam Country Club's particularly memorable holes. These drivable par 4s provide you with the opportunity for an eagle, granted you play skillfully and are blessed with a little luck.",https://www.beaverdamcountryclub.com/,,,,,,
6663,Old Hickory Golf Club,"Beaver Creek divides Old Hickory Golf Club with nine holes sitting north of the creek and nine holes south. The course has a classic parkland layout that plays across gently rolling hills. The fairways were cut through forests of mature hardwoods but they are wide and carefully sculpted to direct balls toward the middle. Skillful players could even try to use the contours to their advantage. Each hole has a bunkers but the bunkering is not excessive. In addition to the mounding and bunkering, the undulating terrain provides natural elevation changes. The golf course finishes with what is arguably its toughest hole. This monster par 5 is 620 yards from the back tees. It requires a drive over a ravine with a natural waste area to the left.

The Red nine stretches to just over 2,600 yards, which is over 100 yards longer than the Blue. The Blue nine features a few holes with water and there are a few strategically placed bunkers to contend with. The back nine is arguably the most challenging at Mascoutin G.C. not only for the length but also because of the abundance of mature trees lining the fairways.",https://www.mascoutingolf.com/,,,,,,

The Oaks is routed through a diverse landscape of rolling hills covered with mature forests and lakes. It also winds alongside the Fox River. Water hazards come into play and there are also strategically placed bunkers to contend with. Tremendous emphasis is placed on accuracy on this golf course, but it is not too punishing if your shots are slightly errant. The course stretches to 6,800 yards from the back tees.

Strategically placed sand traps and water hazards will further test your accuracy. The vigorous golf course is a good test but it is not so formidable that beginners should be intimidated. The par-4 second hole offers one of the most interesting risk-reward situations on the course.

Thankfully, this monster is void of hazards. On the back No. 13 is feast or famine–a short par 5 at 483 yards, but a pond sits in the middle of the fairway.

The rolling terrain provides subtle but tricky undulations in the greens and fairways as well as the occasional double-tiered green. One of the most memorable holes for both its level of difficulty and the scenery is the par-4 third.

The golf course is quite short at 5,881 yards, which makes it pleasantly walkable, but it is certainly not an easy course. The front nine plays across rolling hills while the back nine is centered upon the manmade Lake Wisconsin. The bunkering throughout the golf course is minimal, but it is strategic and fair. The small, fast greens have enough undulations to give them some character but they are not overly difficult though the tricky doglegs shaped by stands of mature trees will test your accuracy. The par-3 12th hole is the signature thanks to a challenging island tee. Lake Wisconsin Country Club's 16th hole also has a memorable tee shot between two towering oak trees followed by a short iron to a well guarded green that backs onto the Wisconsin River.",https://www.lakewisconsincc.com/,,,,,,

The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole.

6985,Reedsburg Country Club,"Reedsburg Country Club is a championship golf course that requires both accuracy and strategy. Originally opened as a nine-hole course in 1925, only three of the original holes still exist today. The course underwent a major renovation in the 1970s that expanded it to a full 18 holes. At only 6,300 yards from the back tees, it is shorter than most modern championship golf courses but don't let the yardage fool you. This course will test you on even its shortest holes. Every hole features either out-of-bounds or a lateral water hazard on one or both sides. Reedsburg Country Club's greens range from small to large but what they have in common is that they are all fast, undulating, and framed with pot bunkers. A creek also meanders in front of the greens of five holes.",https://reedsburgcountryclub.com/,,,,,,

7025,"House On The Rock Resort, The (Front/Back Course at House On The Rock Resort, The)","The Springs Course is the original course at the House on the Rock Resort & Golf Club. There is also the North Nine Course, which was added more than 20 years after the first course. Despite the difference in age and length, both golf courses provide rounds that are as scenic as they are challenging. The Springs is a Robert Trent Jones design, although the lush terrain of the Wisconsin River Valley also deserves credit. The course sweeps along the valley floor and incorporates Jones signature elements, including narrow landing areas and plenty of bunkering. Water hazards also come into play on almost every hole. Two notable holes are the ninth and 18th, par 4s that wind back to a massive double green guarded by water on one side and sand traps on the other.",https://www.thehouseontherock.com/,,,,,,

7032,Cherry Hills Lodge & Golf Course,"Cherry Hills Golf Course sprawls across gently rolling countryside in Sturgeon Bay. The layout tumbles across a variety of elevation changes that make for some challenging, hard-to-read greens. Some have even compared them to Pinehurst's famous greens. Be prepared to have your short-game skills thoroughly tested. The front nine is slightly more forgiving than the back nine where the fairways are narrower and many are lined with out-of-bounds stakes. Water hazards come into play one four holes and there are a few strategically placed sand traps. The golf course is challenging but fair and not too intimidating for beginners, especially since at just over 6,200 yards, it is a manageable length. In addition to the course, there is also a lighted driving range at Cherry Hills G.C.",https://www.golfcherryhills.com/,,,,,,

7055,Rivermoor Country Club,"Originally opened in 1929 as the Waterford Woods Golf Course, the club reemerged in 2008 as the Rivermoor Golf Club. Along with its new name, the club also revealed improvements to the playability and condition of the 18-hole course. The design of the golf course was largely determined by the scenic topography, which is covered with mature trees and dotted with ponds. There are also a few streams that meander across the landscape. Rivermoor Golf Club is a proud member of the Audubon Sanctuary System. Beyond providing a secluded setting and great scenery, the terrain also makes for a challenging round. The trees frame most of the holes and water hazards come into play on a few holes. There are also strategically placed bunkers with which to contend.",https://rivermoorgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

The course originally opened in 1927 as a nine-holer but was renovated and lengthened in the 1980s but the front nine wasn't added until 2004. Only a few holes remained from the original nine-hole course, but they play just as they did in the 20s. The newer front nine has a link-style design that demands accuracy off the tee with 29 sand traps strategically placed throughout the nine holes. There are a variety of other hazards as well. As you move onto the back nine, the golf course's character changes completely. The holes have a traditional design and they are much more wooded with mature trees framing almost every hole, just waiting to knock down an errant tee shot or missed approach.",https://www.golfrrcc.com/,,,,,,

7090,Christmas Mountain Village (Oaks Course at Christmas Mountain Village),"The Oaks Golf Course at Christmas Mountain Village was carefully carved from the rolling hills of Wisconsin Dells. The Oaks is the 18-hole course and it is joined by the nine-hole Pines Course. The names of both courses are indicative of the mature woodland landscape you will find on each. The championship Oaks is a challenging but straightforward layout. You can play it well the first time you play it, so long as you are able to keep it in the short grass. Strategically placed sand traps come into play along many of the greens and there are water hazards on four holes. One of the most memorable holes is the 14th, an uphill par 4 that has three towering oak trees on the left side of the fairway that cause a blind shot to the green.",https://christmasmountainvillage.co/,,,,,,
