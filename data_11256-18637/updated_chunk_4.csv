12499,Northdale Golf & Tennis Club,"Northdale Golf & Tennis Club remains one of the premier Tampa golf courses because of its affordable play, its use of water on 11 of 18 holes, bunkers, rolling undulations and contoured greens that really challenge players. Just 12 miles north of Tampa International Airport, this is a neighborhood golf course with a friendly, relaxed atmosphere that will add to the enjoyment of your day. Renowned golf course architect Ron Garl designed the par 72, 6824-yard championship golf course.

12500,Old Memorial Golf Club,"Named after a nearby highway that was once the only route to the bay area of Tampa, Old Memorial Golf Club opened for play in November 1997.Along with a mixture of subtle and bold contours, Old Memorial's primary design feature is its bunkering. Large and beautifully sculpted, the bunkers have sand faces with long grass fingers that give them the appearance of a series of smaller bunkers. Unlike water hazards, bunkers are often just a quarter or half-shot penalty and recovery is always possible. Smyers' bunkers are dramatic, sweeping hollows of sand that intimidate, deceive, direct play and frame the course's landing areas and greens. Often, they make holes look more difficult than they really are. As one architecture editor wrote, ""Not since MacKenzie or Tillinghast has a golf course architect used bunkering to make such bold statements, express such flair, instill such fear.""Old Memorial Golf Club is a pure, undisturbed sanctuary of golf, where members and guests can get away from the hectic pace of life to enjoy friendly competition, the camaraderie of golfers from diverse backgrounds, and the free exchange of ideas.",https://www.oldmemorialgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

The undulating, tree-lined fairways were designed to mimic a hilly New England course but the moss-covered cypresses, palm trees, and marshy swamplands are true to the Florida landscape. The layout features tight fairways framed with contoured mounding and the occasional water hazard but the most formidable challenge comes from the bunkers strategically placed along the undulating greens.

12904,Woodlawn Country Club,"Once frequented by long-time pro Miller Barber, this old traditional track offers no real surprises on its rolling, tree-lined fairways. Water is in play on only a few holes, one of which is the 136-yard signature–a fun hole because of the peninsula green surrounded by water. The only par 5 plays 495 yards, but there are two 400-yard-plus par 4s on this 6,405-yard, par 71 layout.Getting there : From Dallas, take Hwy. 75 north for 75 miles, then take Exit 65.

12917,Prestwick Country Club,"Designed in the classic Scottish tradition, our masterful six-million dollar creation by Pete and P.B. Dye surrounds a sparkling 20 acre freshwater lake, bordered on the west by a 20,000 square foot colonial clubhouse.The front nine winds through a pine forest in the manner reminiscent of the world famous Dye-designed Harbourtown Golf Course. Only 1/4 mile away from the ocean, the back nine is a more open layout similar to Dye's PGA West course and play is influenced by the prevailing ocean wind.Prestwick features 8 holes where water comes into play.Over 1.3 million cubic yards of earth were moved in creating towering Scottish berms, stairway and church pew bunkers, and undulating greens. In addition, more than 10,000 railroad ties were used to create another classic Dye design. Dramatic elevation changes ranging up to thirty feet add an exceptional feature to this coastal location.Prestwick has been recognized as one of South Carolina's top golf courses and remains enjoyable with extremely limited non-member play and great year-round course conditioning.",https://prestwickcountryclub.com/,,,,,,
12918,Freeport Country Club,"Freeport Country Club is conveniently located just 20 minutes from Portland, Lewis-Auburn, and Brunswick-Topsham and it is also only minutes from one of Maine's most popular attractions, the L.L. Bean flagship store. Freeport itself is also a charming destination, with plenty of shopping and activities available. The nine-hole layout is gentle enough for beginners but there are still a few challenges in store. The holes are tight and golfers will be confronted with the occasional elevated green. The course is known for having some of the area's best maintained greens. There are also three ponds that come into play. Whether you play a nine-hole round or a full 18 holes, the golf course is a great price, especially for the country club-quality. The well conditioned driving range at the club is also popular.",https://mainegolfcenter.org/,,,,,,

The General, North, and South Courses are the championship layouts while the East Course is the nine-hole course. The East is not long at 2,648 yards but don't underestimate its level of difficulty. Accuracy is extremely important on this course and putting requires a deft touch. It offers the same excellent conditions and design that the championship golf courses are known for. The course acts as a good warm-up for the longer courses, but it is also great for beginners since it offers the same challenges but on a smaller scale. The finishing hole is a short par 4 that is a great scoring hole.",https://www.eagleridge.com/,,,,,,

12947,North Shore Country Club,"North Shore Country Club sits along the Intracoastal Waterway, offering holes that play along the ocean as well as some that play inland weaving through coastal marshes and towering pines. The golf course blends seamlessly with the scenic surroundings. Strategically placed bunkers fiercely protect the greens and golfers should also be prepared for some tricky forced carries. The fairways are generous and forgiving though. The course is a fair test but it is especially tough on windy days. The interior, tree-lined holes contrast nicely with the waterfront holes and they have the added benefit of protection from the prevailing sea breezes. North Shore Country Club is a player-friendly layout that both beginners and seasoned players can enjoy, which is why it has become one of the Outer Banks' most popular golfing destinations.",https://www.northshoregolfcoursenc.com/,,,,,,

The greens are elevated, so take enough club.Other notes: Depending on who you talk to, the course may or may not be open to the public, but we’ll go with the Chamber of Commerce’s friendly recommendation that out-of-towners are welcome at HCC. When we originally called to schedule a round that we ended up avoiding, we were abruptly told by the older gentleman who answered the phone that the course wasn’t open to the public. Respect the locals and be on your best behavior when visiting Hillsboro’s course.Getting there : From I-35 south, take Exit 268 (Old Brandon Rd), turn right and go 4 blocks to Country Club Road.

13005,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349. The entrance is 1.5 miles on the left side of the road.",https://www.midlandcc.com/,,,,,,

The resulting layout blends in almost seamlessly with the natural landscape. The golf course is routed through forests of mature oak trees and around five sparkling lakes. The back nine plays along a meandering creek. Water hazards come into play on a total of 13 holes and there are nearly 50 bunkers strategically placed throughout. The golf course demands a fair amount of accuracy but it's not overly punishing if you're errant. The final hole plays from an elevated tee, requiring a carry over the creek in order to reach the green. In addition to the golf course, Oak Ridge also offers a practice facility with a driving range, two practice greens, and a practice bunker.",https://www.senicasoakridge.net/,,,,,,

13032,Ruffled Feathers Golf Club,"Ruffled Feathers Golf Club in Lemont is conveniently situated just a half hour outside downtown Chicago. Pete Dye and his son P.B. collaborated to design the course, making it the only Dye design in the Chicago area. A well thought-out strategy will be greatly rewarded on this challenging layout and bad shots made without any thought will be severely punished. This is definitely not a golf course where you can just grip it and rip it. The fairways are fairly straight and forgiving, but most of the approach shots play to tricky elevated greens. There are also strategically placed bunkers framing the greens and water hazards come into play on several holes as well. Ruffled Feathers Golf Club's par 3s have a reputation for being particularly challenging. But depending on how windy it is, the final hole might present the most formidable challenge.",https://www.ruffledfeathersgc.com/,,,,,,

It is a certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary that offers stunning views of the Des Plaines River nearby. At just over 6,300 yards, the golf course is not particularly lengthy but it still offers some formidable challenges. Water is a prominent feature of the course with ponds and a winding river coming into play on 12 holes. The greens are small and raised and the sculpted fairways are tightly lined with mature trees, demanding accuracy off the tee. Crane's Landing Golf Club's back nine is especially difficult thanks to the river, which runs along the entire left side of the 13th hole and also appears on no. 17, the course's longest hole.",https://www.craneslandinggolf.com/,,,,,,
