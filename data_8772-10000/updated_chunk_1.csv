8775,Port Colborne Country Club,"Port Colborne Golf & Country Club sits just minutes from the banks of Lake Erie. Founded in 1929, it originally opened as a nine-hole course and expanded to a full-length course in 1964. The golf course has matured beautifully over the years with help of major renovations to the design, irrigation, and drainage systems. The layout has rolling fairways that are lined with trees. It is still highly walkable though, since the undulations in the landscape are gentle, which is not to say it does not have its challenges. There are five water hazards and 13 strategically placed sand traps as well as smaller greens that demand accuracy. Port Colborne's practice facilities include a driving range and a putting green with a practice bunker.",https://pcgolf.ca/,,,,,,

8794,Richmond Centennial Golf Course,"Situated just 15 minutes from Ottawa's west end, Richmond Centennial Golf Club is routed through mature woodlands, making it an especially scenic course to visit in the fall. The par-67 course is gentle enough for beginners and juniors, which makes it a great option for families. The golf course originally opened with only one nine in 1967. The front nine has remained largely unaltered over the years, but the back nine that was added later enhanced the course with several challenging elements. The contrast between the player-friendly front nine and the tougher back nine make for an interesting round. Richmond Centennial Golf Club is mostly flat though you will come across a few subtle but tricky slopes. There are also a few water hazards and strategically placed sand traps to watch out for.",https://ottawagolf.com/richmond,,,,,,

The 18-hole golf course stretches across a lush, rolling landscape that is dotted with trees and ponds. The layout features small, impeccably manicured greens and rolling, generous fairways that are player-friendly. Water comes into play on a few holes and there are some strategically placed bunkers throughout, but overall the golf course appeals to players of any skill level. In addition to the course, Ridgetown Golf & Curling Club also offers a driving range, two practice holes, and a putting green for golfers to use.",https://ww38.ridgetowngolf.com/,,,,,,

8832,Sandy Row Golf Club,"Sandy Row Golf Club boasts a split-tee system that uses two different tees for each hole, offering golfers a unique challenge. Every hole has a different feel to it, which guarantees plenty of variety throughout the course. The nine-hole layout is diverse enough to appeal to players of all skill levels. It's challenging enough for advanced players while still being gentle enough for beginners. There are several memorable holes, including the par-5 fifth, which is a tricky double dogleg and the par-3 seventh, which is almost entirely enclosed by water. Sandy Row Golf Club is great for a quick round, but another advantage of the split-tee system is that it allows the course to be played like an 18-hole course, where golfers are confronted with a different tee shot the second time around.",https://www.sandyrowgolf.com/,,,,,,

The club is also known for being tough on your skills but easy on your wallet. The layout takes advantage of the natural assets of the hilly landscape, utilizing the plentiful trees and water features. While the golf course has a delightfully minimalist design, it was made more challenging with the addition of a few strategically placed bunkers.

It's less than an hour from Atlanta, making it a conveniently close getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. The course originally opened in 1990 but in 2008 it changed ownership and underwent a major renovation that elevated its conditions to rival that of any of the area's best golf courses. The bunkers were rebuilt and re-sanded and the fairways were re-conditioned. Bear Creek G.C. has always been known for its excellent greens, which have a reputation for being some of the state's finest putting surfaces. The layout measures 6,585 yards from the back tees, which may seem short but there are some ups and downs throughout that will make it feel much longer.",https://www.bearcreekmonroe.com/,,,,,,

The idyllic, rolling landscape provides plenty of dramatic elevation changes that cause tricky uneven lies throughout. The layout features large, undulating greens that are known to move fast and several strategically placed bunkers. Twenty Valley Golf & Country Club's signature hole is the par-3 13th, which plays uphill and over the Twenty River to a medium-sized green that is precariously perched on top of a stone wall.",https://twentyvalley.com/,,,,,,

There are also variously sized ponds that come into play on the front nine. Carved from mature pine forests, trees are strategically positioned throughout the course. The layout starts out gently enough until you get to the par-4 sixth, which is the first in a series of four tricky holes that plunge into a valley. The highlight of these four holes is the signature ninth, a par 5 that is entirely flanked by water on the right side. Accuracy is essential throughout the layout but especially on those four holes.",http://twincreeksgolf.ca/,,,,,,

8921,Sparrow Lakes Golf Course,"Cardinal Lakes Golf Club offers two 18-hole courses, a championship and an executive. The Sparrow Course is the original executive layout and while it may only be 4,909 yards, it offers the same challenges as its championship sister course. The generous fairways, many of which are doglegs, are flanked with rough areas and there are numerous ponds and lakes that come into play. Surrounded by trees and bunkers, the small greens demand accuracy. It may be a short layout, but this formidable golf course requires careful course management, proper club selection, and solid short game skills. While it may often be overlooked because of its length, the Sparrow is Niagara's most formidable short track",https://cardinallakesgolf.com/,,,,,,
