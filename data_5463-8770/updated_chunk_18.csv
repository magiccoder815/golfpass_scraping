8512,Fairview Golf & Country Club,"Heritage Ranch serves up an especially challenging par 72, 6,988-yard Arthur Hills design that rolls through the oaks and pecans just outside of Fairview. And while it’s part of a gated, active-adult residential community, the course is open to the public and especially fun because it integrates well with the neighborhood. Houses line some fairways, but a fair number of holes provide that natural, rural feel that is always so welcome on a golf course.While the course is not particularly demanding off the tees, the real challenge at Heritage Ranch comes from the mound-shaped greens. If your irons aren’t dialed in, you’ll be working hard for ups and downs.No. 1 is a unique opener because it bends left down to a fairway and green that aren’t visible from the tee. Big drives can get close, but the recommended play is to take a long iron and draw it over the hill.The par 5s on the front are nice holes. No. 3 doglegs right and requires a good tee shot, followed by a relatively easy second shot into a widening fairway toward the hole. The trick is nailing the short iron (almost a blind shot) into the elevated green guarded by bunkers on the front. No. 7 is longer and offers a good chance for birdie, again because of its wide-open nature.No. 16 is the signature hole: a par 3 masterpiece that plays along a natural spring waterfall. You’ll need to nail a long iron over the valley and avoid the trees that overhang the fairway from the right.No. 18 is a good finisher–it’s a long par 4 that doglegs left around a few large fairway bunkers, then works its way uphill to an elevated, mound-shaped green surrounded by bunkers. Ups and downs are possible here if you miss the green back left, which is easy to do when you approach with a fairway wood.Getting there : Only 20 miles northeast of Dallas, take I-75 north to the Stacy Road exit, then turn right and drive to the dead end. The road jogs to the left, then right, and continues as Stacy Road. The entrance is 2 miles down on the left.",https://www.heritageranchgolf.com/,,,,,,

8519,Rio Vista Golf Course,"Opened in 1932, Rio Vista Golf Course has built a reputation over the years as being one of the best public courses on the Niagara Peninsula. Situated in Fort Erie, Frenchman's Creek wanders through the gently undulating landscape of the nine-hole, par-36 course. Don't let the scenic tranquility or the length of the layout fool you though, the layout offers a formidable round. The most challenging feature of the golf course lies in the size of the small greens, which demand accuracy on the approach. The creek comes into play on a few holes and there are also a number of strategically placed bunkers throughout. Rio Vista G.C. also offers a practice green with a sand trap and a driving range.",http://riovistamail.ca/,,,,,,

8547,Victoria Park Golf Club East,"Victoria Park Golf Club East is an 18-hole championship course with a challenging, yet player-friendly dogleg design. The golf course is framed with interesting water hazards, most prominently on the tricky par 3s. Victoria Park Golf Club East also features 38 strategically placed Ohio white sand bunkers and contour-cut fairways, most of which have a thick first cut of rough around them. The golf course appeals to players of all skill levels since a good flop shot with a lob wedge will allow you to get past most of the tricky areas and it is unlikely that you will have many bogeys. Victoria Park Golf Club East takes pride in the meticulously maintained greens and fairways, guaranteeing excellent conditions every time you play.",https://victoriaparkgolf.com/,,,,,,

8566,Hornby Glen Golf Course,"Situated at the base of Halton Hills, Hornby Glen Golf Course was built upon rolling, wide-open terrain. This affordable public course offers the quality and many of the amenities of a private club, including a clubhouse and pro shop. The tumbling landscape provides undulating fairways and expansive, rolling greens where players are likely to three-putt if not patient. Despite the golf course's hilliness, it is surprisingly easy to walk. The layout is gentle enough for beginners but it also provides an excellent way for more advanced golfers to work on their short game. The par-4 eighth is Hornby Glen Golf Course's signature hole, known for the long ravine that appears halfway down the fairway where if you get stuck, you'll be facing a blind shot to the green.",https://golfnorth.ca/hornbyglen/,,,,,,

8574,Ingersoll Golf & Country Club,"The classic design of Ingersoll Golf Club appeals to both avid and casual golfers. The layout is a good mix of holes, tricky doglegs as well as straightaways like the par-5 ninth, which is possible to reach in two. Mature trees line most of the holes and there is the occasional multi-tiered green to watch out for. Water makes an occasional appearance but the far more worrisome element of the round is the strategic bunkering that protects the greens. Ingersroll Golf Club's signature hole is the par-4 third. It features a small elevated green but it is doable with two good shots. The golf course ends with one of its toughest holes, a par 4 whose green is heavily protected on both sides by bunkers.",https://ingersollgolf.com/,,,,,,

The course is situated amid the Sierra Foothills, tumbling across a picturesque desert landscape sprinkled with native flora. The layout has many risk-reward opportunities and the par-3 holes are especially fun. The hilly terrain is as scenic as it is challenging, providing some tricky uneven lies and there is a meandering creek that slithers along the fairways. Though it's wide open, the golf course requires a bit of accuracy and some good course management. The elevated tees offer some spectacular views as well as some intimidating approaches to the fast, undulating greens. In addition to the golf course, Wolf Run also has a practice facility with a driving range and putting and chipping greens.
