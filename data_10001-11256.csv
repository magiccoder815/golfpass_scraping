The small greens have challenging slopes ranging from subtle breaks to dramatic drop-offs. To make them even tougher, you'll find strategically placed bunkers lurking along the edges. The tricky doglegs, which are mostly par 4s, will force you to think carefully about your club selection, and to top it all off, water makes an appearance on almost every hole.

This monster doglegs left inside a cliff that runs along the right side. Out-of-bounds is left, and a fairway bunker resides about a lob wedge from the narrow green, which is bolstered from behind by more bunkers.No. 18 is one of the more interesting finishing holes that you’ll come across, featuring two dogleg fairways, one right and one left, that both involve dealing with the creek that splits the two routes. The tee shot right is more favorable, since it is void of fairway bunkers like the ones on the left side. However, this option involves carrying two bunkers and the creek on the approach.Getting there : From I-20 west, take the Bryant/Irvin Rd. exit and turn left. Drive 2.5 miles to the course.

Although there is an abundance of trees, the course still has many wide-open areas. The pristine white sand bunkers and colorful wildflowers are a beautiful contrast to the lush green of the course. The layout is not particularly long, but golfers should be prepared for a challenging round of target golf.

The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times.

Over the decades that the course has been open, it has hosted a number of professional players and celebrities ranging from Arnold Palmer to Will Smith. George C. Thomas, Jr., who created the Riviera, collaborated with Billy Bell to design the original golf course but Jay Morrish made the layout considerably more challenging with renovations in 1988. Ten years later, two holes from the original Thomas/Bell layout that were lost during a redesign following WWII were completely restored and incorporated into the layout. The challenging golf course is very narrow in some spots and it features undulating greens that putt fast and true. The layout is not particularly long but it requires accuracy and proper club selection in order to score well.",https://www.ojaivalleyinn.com/,,,,,,

Starting from one of golf’s most iconic first-tee perches, the golfer descends, climbs and winds through valleys, over barrancas that come into play on several holes and finally uphill to the amphitheater 18th green.Riviera is home to one of the game’s most recognizable par 3s and one of its great short par 4s. The former is the short 6th hole, with a pot bunker in the middle of the sweeping, multi-tiered green. The latter: the 10th, whose broad fairway and strategic bunkering gives way to one of the toughest-to-hit putting surfaces in the world. Even the best golfers in the world routinely make scores from 2 to 8 there.In addition to the PGA Tour’s annual Genesis Invitational, Riviera has a considerable major championship pedigree, including a U.S. Open (1948) and two PGA Championships (1983, 1995).",https://www.therivieracountryclub.com/,,,,,,

Sometimes getting out of one bunker, just means landing in another at Desert Falls.That is just part of the reason this course totes a 145 slope rating - putting it among the five highest slope ratings in the entire Palms Springs area. Remember, this is the golf mecca with Pete Dye's Stadium Course, which was only designed to be ""the toughest golf course in the world."" Desert Falls is on that list.There are five sets of tees to take away some of the bite. But the greens are still an obstacle of their own. These are undulating greens that are large enough to offer several varieties of challenges.Just getting on the green is not enough at Desert Falls.

11145,"Tradition Golf Club at Wallingford, The","Wheeler Family Traditions Golf Club (formerly known as The Tradition Golf Club at Wallingford) is one of the most affordable rounds in the area and it has received praise as one of the best golf courses in Connecticut. The par-70 layout is player friendly enough for beginners but low handicappers will also find it to be a fun round. The holes are fairly straightforward though there are some fairways that have very narrow landing areas that will test the accuracy of even the best golfers. Numerous bunkers are strategically placed along the undulating greens and water also comes into play on the occasional hole. The golf course starts out gently but becomes progressively more challenging on the back nine. The most memorable hole on the golf course, the par-3 12th, is a water hole that features an intimidating island green.",https://wheelertraditions.com/,,,,,,

It comes into play on 14 holes on this challenging 18-hole layout, which is considered one of the area's best. The course is also home to an abundance of wildlife that includes several different bird species, deer, fox, otters, and even alligators. The front nine starts off gently with a more traditional design but it's the back nine, which weaves through beautiful wetlands, that will test your accuracy. River Pointe Golf Club's signature hole is the par-5 14th. This lengthy hole has water all along the left side and in front of the green, which slopes from back to front. A perfectly placed ball will be rewarded with a chance for a birdie.",https://riverpointegolfcourse.com/,,,,,,

11235,Black Creek Golf Club,"Black Creek Golf Club is an 18-hole, championship course that is conveniently situated less than an hour from Savannah. The course sprawls across acres of rolling countryside, surrounded by nothing but lush meadows and hills, providing the round with peaceful seclusion. The layout is player friendly enough for all skill levels and the blue tees are enough of a challenge for more advanced players. The front nine has a wide-open links-style layout that provides an interesting contrast to the back nine, which is characterized by tree-lined, narrow fairways. The greens are large and undulating and sometimes framed with strategically placed bunkers. The golf course winds through scenic coastal marshes and wetlands, which come into play on 13 holes. There is even an island green on Black Creek Golf Club's signature hole, the par-3 15th.",http://www.blackcreekgolfclub.com/,,,,,,
11236,Lakeview Golf Club,"Lakeview Golf Club is a favorite amongst Delray Beach locals. It is a par-60 executive layout that offers the perfect level of challenge for beginners, juniors, and senior golfers. It is the sister course to Delray Beach Golf Club, a championship course that is less than a mile away. Opened in 1972, the golf course has a classic design that measures just over 3,000 yards. The terrain is mostly flat, making it an enjoyable course to walk. Despite its length the holes have the feel of a championship course. There are 14 par 3s, a fair share of which are quite challenging as opposed to the uniform par 3s you see on some executive courses. For more advanced players, it is a great place to get in a quick round of practice.",https://www.lakeviewgcdelray.com/,,,,,,

The layout isn't characterized by a specific feature but instead lets the lush, rolling terrain remain the focus. The well balanced golf course features numerous sand bunkers strategically placed throughout and water hazards also come into play on a few holes. The distinct 16th hole with its island green is known throughout Atlanta. This par 3 appears intimidating but it is more playable than it looks. Players of all skill levels stand a good shot at reaching the green. In addition to the golf course, Bridgemill Athletic Club offers a driving range and short game area as well as 25 tennis courts and a two-acre aquatic center.",https://www.bridgemillathleticclub.com/,,,,,,

The course is surrounded by a residential area but the holes still manage to feel secluded. The golf course has a traditional layout with wide, forgiving fairways and gently sloping greens. It is gentle enough for the beginning player but it still has challenges in store for more experienced golfers. Strategically placed bunkers come into play along the greens and there are some subtle but tricky elevation changes. It's not the most formidable layout, but it's a good value for the price, especially since in addition to the golf course, there is a 30-tee, lighted driving range. For more advanced players, Oak Mountain is an affordable place to get some practice.",https://www.oakmountainchampionshipgolf.com/,,,,,,
