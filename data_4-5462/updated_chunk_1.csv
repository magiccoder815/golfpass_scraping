39,Avila Beach Resort,"Avila Beach Golf Resort is located right along the bay, giving it a scenic setting that has made it the most well known of the Central Coast golf courses. The layout offers plenty of variety with a hilly front nine that features small, often elevated, greens that are surrounded by oak-lined valleys and a back nine that that is routed across a tidal estuary. Golfers should be prepared for forced carries over water and multi-tiered greens on the backside. At first the course may seem short, but thanks to the dramatic elevation changes and numerous other challenges, it will begin to feel much longer. There are several severe doglegs throughout as well as tight approaches. Avila Beach Golf Resort is not a layout where you can easily ""grip it and rip it.""

The country club sits just 10 minutes outside of downtown Cincinnati.A Scottish golfer and designer, Bendelow created several Midwest courses. Bendelow designed 800-plus North American courses, working with land he was assigned: In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, architects didn't get their turf, rocks and water features trucked in. Born Sept. 2, 1868, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bendelow began golfing when he was 9 years old, with his dad at the Balgownie Links, which now goes by Royal Aberdeen Golf Club - founded in 1780, Royal Aberdeen Golf Club is the world's sixth-oldest, and it's clear that Bendelow had rich inspiration to draw on back in Scotland.After a round of golf at the Western Hills Country Club, head back to the Grill Porch for nibbles and sips.",https://www.westernhillscc.com/,,,,,,

256,Oak Hills Country Club,"""Oak Hills is classic golf architecture at its finest,"" says Carl Bielstein, La Cantera's director of golf, about Oak Hills Country Club's heritage and its noted architect, A.W. Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.oakhillscc.com/,,,,,,

445,Soldiers Creek Golf Club At The Preserve,"The course at Soldiers Creek Golf Club was designed by Scott Clark, a former Golf Course Superintendent at The Grand Hotel in Point Clear Alabama and the current Superintendent at The Peninsula Golf Club in Gulf Shores Alabama. While this is Scott's first attempt in playing the role of a course architect, it also reveals his depth of experience in the golf course industry. The design goals of building a course that would be enjoyable for high handicappers as well as low handicappers was met in this design.The course features wide player-friendly fairways. Also, water comes into play on only two holes which makes navigating this course easier for high handicappers. A large natural turf driving range and 10,000 square foot practice green is available as a warm-up or practice area.Soldiers Creek Golf Club is owned by the Norman Woerner family. Norman is a member of the Woerner Turf family of sod producers. Woerner Turf is a world-wide leader in turf production. The company provides turf for many golf courses ranging from Augusta National to new courses in Hong Kong. They also supply the turf for the NFL Super Bowl and the NFL Pro Bowl in Hawaii.Southern Turf Nurseries provided the Tif Eagle for Soldiers Creek Golf Club. This turf grass is considered by many to be the best-of-the-best turf for southern golf course greens. The fairways and roughs are Tif 419, a dense-growing emerald-colored grass that's perfect for plush fairways.The greens feature Tif Eagle, the newest and best-of-the-best southern turf grass for golf course greens. An increasingly popular choice for new golf courses and redesigns, this turf permits a closer cut, thus allowing for smoother, faster greens.Located only several miles from Alabama's sun-kissed Gulf Coast, this new 18 hole championship course is part of the Woerner Preserve Resort. Our friendly staff welcomes you to play the newest course on the Gulf Coast. Yes, we are now open. Come spend some time with family or friends. Relax and enjoy a round of golf in this natural setting.DIRECTIONS: From I-10, take exit 44 (Gulf Shores Pkwy/Hwy 59 South). Travel south on Hwy 59 for approx. 18 miles. Turn left onto Hwy 98 (at light in Foley). Travel approx. 10 miles to Co. Rd 95. Turn right and go 1 ½ mile. Course is on the left.",https://www.soldierscreekgolfcourse.com/,,,,,,

450,Decatur Country Club,"Everyone in Decatur takes great pride in their beautiful little 9-hole golf course, and that positive attitude is definitely on display when you deal with the ultra-friendly folks at the golf course. Always helpful, with smiles on their faces, and particularly friendly to out-of-towners, it sure makes it a joy to play golf when you’re treated with that sort of charming hospitality.Golf is even better nowadays in Decatur because of the renovated greens, which look pristine and roll true. This course is flat, with water in play on about 3 holes, and the par 36 design offers a good combination of holes. The opener is testy, and not an easy par–it plays 440 yards to a par 4. There are three par 3s, two of which require long irons, and three par 5s, one of which is listed as the number one handicap: the No. 6 hole at 542 yards.Getting there : From Hwy, 380 exit, take the Airport exit and cross over the highway. Veer right and turn left at the stop sign. Turn right on Country Club Dr.",https://www.facebook.com/decaturgolfclub,,,,,,

522,Tehama Golf Club,"This Jay Morrish design above the city of Carmel shares the name of an apparel line that actor Clint Eastwood helped start in the late 1990s. The terrain is hilly at this exclusive club, and Morrish made great use of it, creating some breathtaking views. Six holes play uphill, and the greens have plenty of slope. Several holes also criss-cross, but they are laid out in such a manner that they do not interfere with each other. There are no tee times at Tehama Golf Club, and the parking lot and maintenance facility are both underground.",https://www.tehamagolfclub.com/,,,,,,

525,"Preserve Golf Club, The","The Preserve Golf Club is evidence of Jerry Pate's belief that a golf course should enhance the natural aesthetic of the land and provide flexibility of shot values. The 18-hole public course, designed by the U.S. Open champion and award winning golf course designer, is adjacent to an 1,800-acre nature preserve.Mossy, majestic live oaks reach out over the golf course, and tall, slender long leaf pines line the generous fairways. Wild, wiry grasses disperse texture and color against the smooth, rolling greens. The uniquely Southern cypress swamps, marshy wetlands and pitcher plant bogs scatter the area, adding diversity to the landscape and challenge to the game.The Preserve Golf Club, which opened in 2006, measures 6,774 yards from the longest tees and has a slope rating of 136 and a 72.8 USGA rating. The course features four sets of tees for different skill levels.Golf Digest selected the course as one of America's Best New Courses in the ""Best New Public $75 and Over"" category for 2007.",https://www.preservegc.com/,,,,,,
