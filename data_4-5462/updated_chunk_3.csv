1229,"Bluffs on Thompson Creek, The","The Bluffs on Thompson Creek enjoys a beautiful setting tucked away amid mature hardwood forests. Creeks freely meander throughout the golf course, interconnecting with the sparkling ponds that can be found throughout. The layout is an Arnold Palmer design that takes advantage of the hills, bluffs, and hollows of the varied landscape. You face uneven lies and a few blind shots thanks to the terrain but you'll also get scenic views of the surrounding area. Accuracy is important to have but it's not an overly punishing layout if you happen to be errant. The golf course has a challenging start with an uphill par 3 as the opening hole. Another memorable hole is the par-3 eighth, which features a 50-foot drop to the fairway below. It's both an intimidating and beautiful hole.",https://thebluffs.com/,,,,,,

1241,Oak Harbor Golf Club,"Situated just 25 minutes outside of New Orleans, Oak Harbor Golf Club is one of the area's most popular courses. The course is a challenging test without being too intimidating for beginners. It offers risk-reward holes that will appeal to low and high handicappers alike. Lee Schmidt, who worked closely with Pete Dye, designed the golf course, and incorporated many of Dye's signature features into the design. Sculpted mounding and native grasses frame the generous landing areas and you'll even find Dye's trademark railroad ties framing the greens. There are also several lakes that come into play throughout. Oak Harbor Golf Club's seventh and 15th holes are particularly notable for their intimidating tee shots over water. If you strategize carefully, the four par 5s provide some birdie opportunities but you'll have to carefully navigate through a combination of water, traps, and undulations.",https://www.oakharborgolf.com/,,,,,,

The club first opened in 1969 with a nine-hole golf course, which was later expanded to 18 holes in 1972. A renovation of the golf course resulted in a redesign of five holes on the front nine and a new irrigation system. Southbrook Golf & Country Club now plays to a 6,560 yards and its new challenges demand precision and keen course strategy. The meandering Welland river snakes through the golf course as well, coming into play on 13 holes while also enhancing the natural beauty of the course.",https://southbrookgolf.ca/,,,,,,
1279,Austin Country Club,"Back around 1900, when the greater Austin area was only home to about 25,000 residents, Harvard Law School graduate and lifetime Austinite Lewis Hancock organized one of Texas’ first formal country clubs, the venerable Austin Country Club.The first nine-hole course, now known as Hancock Park, featured sand greens and a tiny two-room framed clubhouse. The club stayed put for half a century, noted for the presence of Harvey Penick. Then after a huge local debate, the facility was moved to Riverside Drive in East Austin. From there it made it another 35 years before moving to its current Davenport Ranch location.The current ACC layout, designed by Pete Dye, rests on the shores of Lake Austin and the Colorado River. Dye didn’t veer from his usual method of creating an impressively difficult track using his trademark railroad ties, deep pot bunkers, and huge undulations.The opening holes play along Lake Austin, and are more of a links-style design. Afterwards the Hill Country takes effect, featuring canyons, ravines, creeks, and unbelievable views.The back nine features many outstanding holes, including the 446-yard No. 11, which deceptively doglegs left along a canyon before requiring an approach over that same deep ravine. The par 3 No. 16 also stands out, featuring a long carry over another canyon.",https://www.austincountryclub.com/,,,,,,

Due to the lack of soil, construction required 100,000 cubic yards of soil to be dredged from the lake bottom and spread over the entire course. Suffice it to say that those strings would never be pulled in today’s environmentally conscious age.Getting there : From Highway 620 west, drive about 6 miles past the dam and turn right on Lakeway Drive.
