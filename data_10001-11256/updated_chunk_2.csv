The course has a links-style layout that is challenging but still player-friendly enough to appeal to beginners, seniors, and juniors. The layout is wide open and quite forgiving but there are still plenty of hazards with which to contend. There are more than 50 strategically placed bunkers throughout the golf course. Their thoughtful placement makes up the bulk of the layout's challenges. There are ponds that come into play on six holes as well as tall native grasses that appear along the fairways and greens. The wind is often a factor on the course too and will test your accuracy even further. Frog Hollow Golf Club's par 3s and par 5s are manageable but the par 4s will test even the best players.",https://www.froghollowgolfclub.com/,,,,,,

10987,Black Bear/Grizzly Course at Bear Trap Dunes Golf Club,"Bear Trap Dunes Golf Club boasts 27 holes of championship golf that are situated on a scenic stretch of coastline, just a few miles west of Bethany Beach. The holes are played in three different 18-hole combinations that tumble across sandy dunes and grassy hollows. The natural contours of the coastal landscape largely determined the movement and flow of all three nine-hole courses. The nines, Grizzle, Kodiak, and Black Bear, all have winding fairways bordered by native wetland grasses and lush, oversized greens that boast some of the best conditions on the Eastern Shore. The Black Bear/Grizzly combination is the longest of the three golf courses. Not only does the coastal terrain provide many natural hazards, including several water features, there are also strategically placed bunkers with which to contend.",https://www.beartrapdunes.com/,,,,,,
10989,Kings Creek Country Club,"From the tips, Kings Creek can play particularly tough because of the prevailing winds off the shores of Cedar Creek Lake. However, on calm days this course can be had, since the layout is fairly basic and features water on only six holes. In the late 1980s, the course became known for its improving condition, and that reputation has held true over the years.The front nine is shorter and a little easier than the front, its toughest hole being the 200 -yard No. 3 over water. No. 14 typifies the longer back: a 576-yard marathon with water on either side of the fairway.Getting there : From Dallas, take I-175 south, then turn right on Hwy. 274. The course is 2 miles down the road.",https://www.kccountryclub.com/,,,,,,

The par-70 layout is player friendly enough for beginners but low handicappers will also find it to be a fun round. The holes are fairly straightforward though there are some fairways that have very narrow landing areas that will test the accuracy of even the best golfers. Numerous bunkers are strategically placed along the undulating greens and water also comes into play on the occasional hole. The golf course starts out gently but becomes progressively more challenging on the back nine. The most memorable hole on the golf course, the par-3 12th, is a water hole that features an intimidating island green.",https://wheelertraditions.com/,,,,,,

The course is also home to an abundance of wildlife that includes several different bird species, deer, fox, otters, and even alligators. The front nine starts off gently with a more traditional design but it's the back nine, which weaves through beautiful wetlands, that will test your accuracy. River Pointe Golf Club's signature hole is the par-5 14th. This lengthy hole has water all along the left side and in front of the green, which slopes from back to front.

The layout is player friendly enough for all skill levels and the blue tees are enough of a challenge for more advanced players. The front nine has a wide-open links-style layout that provides an interesting contrast to the back nine, which is characterized by tree-lined, narrow fairways. The greens are large and undulating and sometimes framed with strategically placed bunkers. The golf course winds through scenic coastal marshes and wetlands, which come into play on 13 holes.

The terrain is mostly flat, making it an enjoyable course to walk. Despite its length the holes have the feel of a championship course. There are 14 par 3s, a fair share of which are quite challenging as opposed to the uniform par 3s you see on some executive courses.

It is gentle enough for the beginning player but it still has challenges in store for more experienced golfers. Strategically placed bunkers come into play along the greens and there are some subtle but tricky elevation changes. It's not the most formidable layout, but it's a good value for the price, especially since in addition to the golf course, there is a 30-tee, lighted driving range.
