8380,Bay of Quinte Country Club,"Bay of Quinte Golf & Country Club in Belleville is a parkland course that sprawls across rolling hills. The lush landscape is covered in trees, mosses, ferns, and grasses. The front nine was designed in 1921 and the back nine was added 30 years later making it a full-length championship golf course. The layout features fairly large greens that are fast and undulating and there are narrow fairways, some of which are lined with trees. Water hazards come into play on five holes and there are white sand bunkers throughout the golf course. Bay of Quinte Golf & Country Club's signature hole is the par-4 15th, which features an elevated tee that plays to a well protected green that is surrounded by a tree, bunkers to the left, and mounding to the back and sides.

The club first opened in 1969 with a nine-hole golf course, which was later expanded to 18 holes in 1972. A renovation of the golf course resulted in a redesign of five holes on the front nine and a new irrigation system. Southbrook Golf & Country Club now plays to a 6,560 yards and its new challenges demand precision and keen course strategy. The meandering Welland river snakes through the golf course as well, coming into play on 13 holes while also enhancing the natural beauty of the course.",https://southbrookgolf.ca/,,,,,,

8434,Grand Valley Golf & Country Club,"Located in Cambridge, Grand Valley Golf Course has become an area favorite since opening in 1982. Each of the 18 holes has its own unique character that combine to offer something for every golfer. The front nine of the course features narrow, tree-lined fairways and challenging greens that are difficult to read. Right away, golfers are forced to choose accuracy over distance since straying from the fairways could result in an extremely difficult lie. Golfers will be able to make up for this on the back nine where long hitters have the opportunity to showcase their skills. These holes open up a bit more and feature wider fairways. Distance off the tees will be met with great rewards at Grand Valley Golf Course.",https://www.grandvalleygolf.com/,,,,,,

There is some slight undulation in the bent grass fairways but overall the terrain is flat, making it accessible for beginners since there are no dramatic elevation changes or severely uneven lies. The front nine has numerous water hazards and plays a bit longer than the back nine due to a handful of lengthy par 5s. Cranberry Golf Course's back nine plays shorter and dryer but there are difficult doglegs and several large, strategically placed sand traps. There are also grass bunkers and contouring around the greens for added challenge.",https://www.golfcranberry.com/,,,,,,

Ponds were added to create water hazards on 12 holes, but the natural landscape of the golf course was taken into consideration when planning their placement. Duntroon Highlands Golf Club's fairways are fairly wide and there are trees bordering some. The hilly terrain provides some undulation in the greens, which are fast and vary in size. The golf course begins with scenic views but as it moves towards lowland forest on the back nine, the layout becomes considerably more challenging. Duntroon Highlands G.C.'s signature hole is the par-4 sixth, which features a water hazard and an elevated green that is protected by a grass swale in front.",https://www.duntroongolf.ca/,,,,,,
