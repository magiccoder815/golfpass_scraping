8775,Port Colborne Country Club,"Port Colborne Golf & Country Club sits just minutes from the banks of Lake Erie. Founded in 1929, it originally opened as a nine-hole course and expanded to a full-length course in 1964. The golf course has matured beautifully over the years with help of major renovations to the design, irrigation, and drainage systems. The layout has rolling fairways that are lined with trees. It is still highly walkable though, since the undulations in the landscape are gentle, which is not to say it does not have its challenges. There are five water hazards and 13 strategically placed sand traps as well as smaller greens that demand accuracy. Port Colborne's practice facilities include a driving range and a putting green with a practice bunker.",https://pcgolf.ca/,,,,,,

8794,Richmond Centennial Golf Course,"Situated just 15 minutes from Ottawa's west end, Richmond Centennial Golf Club is routed through mature woodlands, making it an especially scenic course to visit in the fall. The par-67 course is gentle enough for beginners and juniors, which makes it a great option for families. The golf course originally opened with only one nine in 1967. The front nine has remained largely unaltered over the years, but the back nine that was added later enhanced the course with several challenging elements. The contrast between the player-friendly front nine and the tougher back nine make for an interesting round. Richmond Centennial Golf Club is mostly flat though you will come across a few subtle but tricky slopes. There are also a few water hazards and strategically placed sand traps to watch out for.",https://ottawagolf.com/richmond,,,,,,

The 18-hole golf course stretches across a lush, rolling landscape that is dotted with trees and ponds. The layout features small, impeccably manicured greens and rolling, generous fairways that are player-friendly. Water comes into play on a few holes and there are some strategically placed bunkers throughout, but overall the golf course appeals to players of any skill level. In addition to the course, Ridgetown Golf & Curling Club also offers a driving range, two practice holes, and a putting green for golfers to use.",https://ww38.ridgetowngolf.com/,,,,,,

8832,Sandy Row Golf Club,"Sandy Row Golf Club boasts a split-tee system that uses two different tees for each hole, offering golfers a unique challenge. Every hole has a different feel to it, which guarantees plenty of variety throughout the course. The nine-hole layout is diverse enough to appeal to players of all skill levels. It's challenging enough for advanced players while still being gentle enough for beginners. There are several memorable holes, including the par-5 fifth, which is a tricky double dogleg and the par-3 seventh, which is almost entirely enclosed by water. Sandy Row Golf Club is great for a quick round, but another advantage of the split-tee system is that it allows the course to be played like an 18-hole course, where golfers are confronted with a different tee shot the second time around.",https://www.sandyrowgolf.com/,,,,,,

The club is also known for being tough on your skills but easy on your wallet. The layout takes advantage of the natural assets of the hilly landscape, utilizing the plentiful trees and water features. While the golf course has a delightfully minimalist design, it was made more challenging with the addition of a few strategically placed bunkers.

It's less than an hour from Atlanta, making it a conveniently close getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. The course originally opened in 1990 but in 2008 it changed ownership and underwent a major renovation that elevated its conditions to rival that of any of the area's best golf courses. The bunkers were rebuilt and re-sanded and the fairways were re-conditioned. Bear Creek G.C. has always been known for its excellent greens, which have a reputation for being some of the state's finest putting surfaces. The layout measures 6,585 yards from the back tees, which may seem short but there are some ups and downs throughout that will make it feel much longer.",https://www.bearcreekmonroe.com/,,,,,,

The idyllic, rolling landscape provides plenty of dramatic elevation changes that cause tricky uneven lies throughout. The layout features large, undulating greens that are known to move fast and several strategically placed bunkers. Twenty Valley Golf & Country Club's signature hole is the par-3 13th, which plays uphill and over the Twenty River to a medium-sized green that is precariously perched on top of a stone wall.",https://twentyvalley.com/,,,,,,

There are also variously sized ponds that come into play on the front nine. Carved from mature pine forests, trees are strategically positioned throughout the course. The layout starts out gently enough until you get to the par-4 sixth, which is the first in a series of four tricky holes that plunge into a valley. The highlight of these four holes is the signature ninth, a par 5 that is entirely flanked by water on the right side. Accuracy is essential throughout the layout but especially on those four holes.",http://twincreeksgolf.ca/,,,,,,

The Sparrow Course is the original executive layout and while it may only be 4,909 yards, it offers the same challenges as its championship sister course. The generous fairways, many of which are doglegs, are flanked with rough areas and there are numerous ponds and lakes that come into play. Surrounded by trees and bunkers, the small greens demand accuracy. It may be a short layout, but this formidable golf course requires careful course management, proper club selection, and solid short game skills. While it may often be overlooked because of its length, the Sparrow is Niagara's most formidable short track",https://cardinallakesgolf.com/,,,,,,

The DGV Golf & Nature certificate in silver confirms this success.A varied round of golf awaits you on a course that will give you a lot of pleasure, but also requires a tactical game.We hope you have a great game!",https://www.golfclubolching.de/,,,,,,

Past the beautiful things, you walk along the oak grove to the clubhouse - in true half-timbered style.A friendly welcome, perhaps a quick purchase in the pro shop, and then you can start your round. The precise allocation of starting times - even during the week - means there is no crowding at the tee.After a few strokes on the driving range and a few skillful chips and putts, you head to the first tee. You get a first impression of the course at tee 1: a dogleg to the right over meadows means that many a short tiger line drive disappears among the Heidschnucken. Precise play is required across the entire course, scattered drives quickly end up in the dense forest, in the numerous bunkers and lakes. A course that is certainly difficult; played tactically, however, it is an absolute must for every golfer. Add to that the beautiful heath landscape through which the 18 completely differently designed holes with their well-kept fairways and greens run. After the game, you can relax wonderfully on the club terrace with a view of the course. Anyone who wants to can join one another at the long tables. The boss is also always up for a chat. He is happy to talk about the beginnings at the club, the daily maintenance of the course or give tips for your own game.A successful day of golf is coming to an end - a shame, actually, some holes could certainly have been played differently...",https://www.gc-badbevensen.de/,,,,,,

With its unique location on the island of pleasure in the intercoastal waterway and Lake Sabine, this 6,900-yard track has a bit of character, with loads of donated Florida palm trees as well as uncharacteristic elevation changes that were the result of the dredged ship channel. In fact, the island itself came about in the early 1900s as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cut the ship channel and piled mud from the bottom of Sabine Lake.Getting there : Once on Pleasure Island, look for the water tower on that looks like a golf ball sitting on a tee.",https://www.pleasureislandtx.com/rec_golf.html,,,,,,

9936,Dunfermline Golf Club,"Dunfermline Golf Club has had four homes, which seems like a lot, except it has been around since 1887. So that averages to one home every 30 years. The math is a little fuzzy, though, because the club has been at Pitfirrane since 1953.The current golf course was designed by architect J.R. Stutt. He played loose with the length, giving Dunfermline five par 5s and five par 3s, an unusual combo that gives the golf course lots of variety from hole to hole. In fact, on the front nine, no par is repeated twice, a streak that isn't broken until No. 10, which starts a string of three par 4s.The most taxing stretch, unless you have a booming driver, has to be the final five holes, start at No. 14, called ""West Lodge,"" a 381-yard par 4. You have to drive left to avoid a big tree on the right. The green is surrounded by trees also. No. 15 is a 479-yard par 5 called The Pentlands. You get a reprieve on Myrend, the 16th, a par 3 with a reasonable length of 156 yards and a generous green, albeit littered with bunkers.The Dunfermline golf course closes with a bang, starting on 17, Malcolm's Wheel, a 497-yard par 5. Your second shot will be blind, with a small green free of bunkers. No. 18 is the real monster, though. Halketts Hame is the longest on the course at 528 yards.

Machrie, also the home of the Islay Golf Club, is located on the tiny Isle of Islay, 15 miles off Scotland's west coast.Apart from a few changes made in the 1980s by Donald Steel, this challenging golf course has changed little in more than 100 years and has a fascinating history. The Machrie's main claim to fame is its own Open Championship of 1901, which included the Great Triumvirate of Harry Vardon, John Henry Taylor and James Braid.At 6,782 yards, Machrie's length is modest by today's standards, but that doesn't detract from the challenge it musters.

9938,Portlethen Golf Club,"The course is maturing into one of the more popular parkland courses in the North East of Scotland having been blessed with natural features the principal one being the Findon burn which, lined with mature broadleaf trees, crosses 5 of the holes on the first nine influencing either tee or approach shots.The par 5 485 yard fourth hole poses a problem of choice of second shots as the burn crosses 90 yards short of the green, the wayward shot punished by ending up in the burn or in the trees. The inward 9 holes carry fewer hazards but the Findon burn continues to create problems at the fifteenth and eighteenth.Arguably the fifteenth is the 'signature hole' of the course. First, the tee shot has to be accurate to cope with the right to left dog leg and then the approach shot, from a down hill lie, has to carry the Findon burn which, moat like, guards the entrance to the green. The par 507 yd par 5 eighteenth is a challenging closing hole featuring a drystone dyke on the left running all the way from tee to green with the risk of out of bounds with even' shot. The Findon burn. 1(K) yards short of the green creates a further dilemma of second shot selection; to carry or not to carry.Senior golfers and visitors normally play the shorter par 70 'Blue Tee' course.Course development has seen the planting of around 21.000 carefully selected trees, restoration of drystone dykes. construction of stone bridges, new tees at several holes and a pond at the short fifth.
