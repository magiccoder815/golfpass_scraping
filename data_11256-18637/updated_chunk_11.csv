It is considered one of finest golf destinations in the Carolinas. The golf course enjoys a coastal landscape of protected salt marshes and a vast expanse of maritime forest. The layout is routed through freshwater lagoons and marshes, which means you'll be facing water on several holes. Rolling dunes provide subtle but challenging contours throughout the course as well. The terrain is tough enough but there are also the ever-present winds to contend with. For some scenic respite from this formidable test, scenic views of the Atlantic can be enjoyed on almost every hole. In addition to the golf course, the club boasts an extensive practice facility that includes a driving range with three target greens, chipping and putting greens, and a short game area.",https://bhiclub.net/,,,,,,

Just about every hole has its own character. The greens are mostly large and sloped. You will find adequate room off the tee, but if you miss the fairway, you’ll end up in deep rough and pine trees and might not find your ball.

Many of his designs demand strong iron play and accurate tee shots, and this course is no different. Small, fast greens are the course's signature feature. Undulating breaks make them difficult to read at times. The layout starts with a relatively open front nine where bunkered greens are the most prominent challenges. The back nine is longer and there are more trees and penalty ditches. The 16th hole is one of the most challenging on the golf course with a plateau green that sits four feet above the fairway and flanked with bunkers. The title of most difficult hole though, goes to Benvenue Country Club's fourth hole. There are out-of-bounds along the entire right side of the fairway on this hole and the narrow opening to the green is tightly bordered by three bunkers.",https://www.benvenuecountryclub.com/,,,,,,

From the elevated tees you'll get a view of the surrounding mountains and the winding streams that meander through the golf course. The wide fairways are bordered by colorful wildflowers and the greens have subtle but tricky undulations. The par-5 sixth is one of the most memorable holes on the course.

Golfers can expect a few perilous carries over water. To add to the layout's difficulty, there are numerous bunkers strategically placed along the greens. The golf course is arguably one of the area's most formidable tests. Although thoughtful strategy and creative shot making will be generously rewarded, it’s not an overly punishing layout.

The club was founded in 1936 by Marvin Leonard, who sought to have a north Texas club with smooth, bent grass greens (unheard of at the time, as many courses had either sand or Bermuda turf). The course was originally designed by Texan John Bredemus and Oklahoma architect Perry Maxwell, who formally worked with Dr. Alister Mackenzie. Holes no. 3-5 are nicknamed the “Horrible Horseshoe” and represent the strongest stretch on the course, featuring a 247-yard par-3 4th hole bookended by long and demanding par 4s. Colonial Country Club hosted the 1941 U.S. Open, won by Craig Wood and was the first time the event was staged in Texas. Despite now playing over 7,200 yards, Colonial maintains a reputation to this day as a ball-striker’s playground. Ben Hogan won the Colonial golf tournament five times.

Phelps' design features plush, narrow fairways, and its namesake Forest Creek that comes into play on 11 holes. Many of the holes dogleg, and its most difficult holes are the long par 4s. These holes are especially evident on the back nine, with holes 10, 15, and 18 all playing well over 400 yards.

17299,"Gauntlet At St. James Plantation,The","The Founders Club was the original layout at St. James Plantation in Southport. It was later joined by two other 18-hole championship courses and a 27-hole golf course. P.B. Dye designed the Founders. It boasts one of the highest slope ratings in the region and also some of the best views. Dye took full advantage of the coastal Carolina landscape, incorporating the natural wetlands into several holes. The final three are especially memorable water holes, playing over a series of marshes and lakes. The undulating greens follow the natural contours of the landscape and they are accented with pot bunkers to add some challenge. Dye also included his signature multi-level fairways. The careful preservation of the landscape on not only this course but also all of the golf courses at St. James have earned each one designation as an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary.",https://www.theclubsatstjames.com/,,,,,,

This tight golf course has winding, narrow fairways and water hazards coming into play on 13 holes. There are also numerous bunkers strategically placed throughout as well as thick cuts of rough. The signature hole is the par-4 seventh, which was inspired by his father's 18th hole at TPC Sawgrass.

There are more than 30 bunkers strategically placed throughout. Still, the most difficult element of the course is the varied shapes and contours of the greens, which can make them tough to hit.
