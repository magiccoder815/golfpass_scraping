15893,"Bay Club, The -East","Formerly known as Championship at East Bay Golf Course.Timpanogos Golf Club is in Provo about 1 hour south of Salt Lake City. The course is located on the Novell/Word Perfect campus which explains why there is an executive course in addition to the regular 18 hole course.One word describes the hazards at Timpanogos -- water. Water comes into play on almost every hole and there are several forced carries. This can be one of the most challenging (and frustrating) courses in the area if you're not hitting the ball straight. It's possible to empty your ball bag on this course on a bad day.Favorite holes are number 4 and number 10 (now some other number because the back nine was reordered during 1997). Number 4 is a par 4 which requires a blind tee shot over a marsh. Too short or left and you're dead in the marsh, too far right and you're either wet or are faced with a long second shot. Number 10 (maybe 12 now) is a par five that offers several ways to attack, all of them dangerous. If you go for the green in 2 you have to carry the entire length of a pond. To lay up you have to hit a narrow fairway and risk going too far through and out of bounds.",https://www.timpanogosgolf.com/,,,,,,

He routed the front nine along the bay while the back nine borders the St. Martin's River, through mature hardwoods and pristine marshland. The golf course is home to the longest cart bridge in the country, stretching almost 1,500 feet to bring golfers from the bay-side holes to the marshland holes. It is also the only course in the U.S. with five consecutive holes playing to the same double green. The signature hole is the par-3 fifth, which requires a carry over a marsh to a nearly island green bordered by water on three sides.",https://lighthousesound.com/,,,,,,

The front nine is wide open with some room for error but the back nine is routed through woodlands, demanding accuracy and thoughtful strategy. There is an interesting variety of holes as well including short par 4s, moderate par 5s, and tough par 3s that are made even more difficult on a windy days.

Thankfully, this monster is void of hazards. On the back No. 13 is feast or famine–a short par 5 at 483 yards, but a pond sits in the middle of the fairway.

The greens are known for being challenging and they are also some of the truest and smoothest putting surfaces you'll find in the area.

The hazards at Marshfield C.C. are mostly provided by the existing landscape, including the meandering creeks, mature trees, and rocky outcroppings, which are complemented by several strategically placed bunkers.

16271,Meadowbrook Country Club,"Meadowbrook Country Club in Racine is just a short drive from Milwaukee and Kenosha as well as northeastern Illinois. The golf course is interwoven with a meandering creek that is connected to three ponds, all of which come into play on several holes throughout the course. The terrain is mostly flat though there is some slope to the fast, medium-sized greens. The lack of elevation changes is quickly overshadowed by the presence of strategically placed bunkers on almost every hole. The golf course offers plenty of challenges but it is player friendly enough for players to approach with confidence no matter what their handicap is. The versatile layout has a playability that makes it ideal for tournaments and outings. Meadowbrook C.C. has hosted several events over the years, including numerous Wisconsin state opens.",https://www.meadowbrookracine.com/?utm_source=redirect&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=mccdicarlo%20redirect,,,,,,

16298,Oak Hills Country Club,"""Oak Hills is classic golf architecture at its finest,"" says Carl Bielstein, La Cantera's director of golf, about Oak Hills Country Club's heritage and its noted architect, A.W. Tillinghast. Built in 1921, Oak Hills Country Club compares favorably to the architect's other famed courses: Winged Foot, Baltusrol and Bethpage Black. Bielstein said he believes Tillinghast noted the elevation and the abundance of trees when he created the golf course in 1921. ""Golf architects of that era took advantage of the natural landscape to develop a new course, Bielstein says about the man who many consider the dean of golf course architects.Oak Hills Country Club members say the golf course returned to its original design thanks to the 1984 work of golf architect Jay Morrish. Morrish convinced the Oak Hills CC membership, most notably its greens committee, to return Oak Hills to Tillinghast's original vision for the course in 1984. Plenty of water and mature oak trees are ever present on the golf course.",https://www.oakhillscc.com/,,,,,,
