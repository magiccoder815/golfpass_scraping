Like many of Ross' designs, the phrase ""hard par, easy bogey"" holds true here. The layout features small greens with crown centers that are sloped back to front. Rough borders the fairways and the wide-openness of the course means that wind will often be a factor. Lake Wales C.C. is a challenging but straightforward golf course.

The golf club bought the old Nashville Golf and Country Club's clubhouse and land for $22,500, leased an additional 92 acres on which to build an 18-hole golf course and enlisted the golf course architect Donald Ross to lay it all out.Of course, golfers at the Richland Country Club today are playing an all-new golf course in an all-new spot, this one a Jack Nicklaus Signature Golf Course that runs alongside the Granny White Park.After a round at the Richland Country Club, head back to the clubhouse and the Waxo Greene Grille for casual eats and sweet vistas of the golf course, not to mention a round around the fireplace.",https://www.richlandcc.com/,,,,,,

In addition to the course, Olde Fort has a driving range as well as chipping and putting greens for golfers to use.

840,Midland Country Club,"MCC has served as the home of the elite in Midland since 1927. Since moving to its current location in 1954, it's maintained the reputation as one of the best and longest in the state. Designer Ralph Plummer must have been caught in some sort of a West Texas oil-patch pissing match in the midst of macho oil men when his ego prompted him to create a 7,380-yard monstrosity in an area that often is bombarded with 30-40 mph winds!On hole after hole, golfers face long, narrow fairways lined with thick, mature trees, which themselves are lined with the famous rattlesnake-infested mesquite ""jungles"" that suck golf balls out of the West Texas wind. Crushed drives that find the fairway don't necessarily warrant pats on the back, as a long iron or even a 3-wood off the deck awaits the over-confident hack on his approach. Water comes into play in strategic places (7 holes), wreaking even more havoc on your round. The bent-grass greens are large and sometimes impossible to handle because of their speed.Every hole is impressive, but the 601-yard 15th stands out, snaking its way right off the tee, then left for the second shot, and finally back to the right again into a massive, bowl-shaped, elevated green. Tiger Woods could not reach this hole in two.Other notes: Ron Kirby redesigned the course in 1979, followed by Dick Nugent in 1985. This club hosted the 1997 Texas State Amateur. The club currently has plans for extensive renovation of the clubhouse.Getting there : Drive north out of Midland toward Lubbock on Hwy. 349.

Water hazards and bunkers come into play frequently throughout the entire Forest Dunes golf course. As if 18 challenging holes weren't enough, Weiskopf built a 19th hole that plays uphill and across water to a green that has a bunker right in the middle.",https://forestdunesgolf.com/,,,,,,
966,Thoroughbred Golf Club at Double JJ Resort,"Thoroughbred Golf Club is the centerpiece of the Double JJ Resort in Rothbury. It consistently ranks as one of West Michigan's top courses. The course is as beautiful as it is challenging with a landscape of lush rolling hills blanketed with mature trees. Golfers should be prepared for a variety of elevation changes and tricky uneven lies. Natural marsh areas come into play and there is a combination of conventional and pot bunkers, some with sod walls that make recovery difficult. Trees and mounding border the fairways and the challenging greens features a mix of ridges, tiers, and undulations. The no. 1 handicap hole is the second, which is both dramatically scenic and hard, This tough par 4 can be reached in regulation with a risky shot over the wetlands or it can be played safe to the right on the second shot.",https://doublejj.com/thoroughbred-golf-club/,,,,,,

1008,Moose Ridge Golf Course,"Moose Ridge Golf Club sprawls across rolling hills blanketed with mature trees and accented with colorful wildflowers. There are more than 90 feet of elevation changes throughout the course, but there are more challenges than the hilly terrain. Well defined bunkers lurk along the greens and acres of wetlands come into play. It's easy to get distracted on this visually stunning golf course, but it's a test that requires all of your attention. The first hole is challenging but gentler than the next three holes, which is one of the toughest sequences in the area. The second and thrid are long uphill par 4s and the fourth is a narrow par 5 with a marsh-protected green. Moose Ridge Golf Club's back nine opens more gently but the respite doesn't last for long. The 15th is one of the most challenging holes, starting with a tee shot over water and followed by an approach to a narrow green.",https://mooseridgegolfcourse.com/,,,,,,

1021,Pine River Golf Course,"Pine River Golf Course sprawls across gently rolling hills dotted with mature trees. The course's namesake river weaves in and out of the holes. The course has a challenging layout that offers front and back nines that are completely different. Take advantage of the scoring opportunities on the fairly forgiving front nine because you're in for a tougher test on the back nine. The holes on the backside are more heavily treed and demand greater accuracy. Strategically placed bunkers frame the greens, making the approaches even more intimidating, and the river also comes into play. Straight shots will be rewarded at Pine River G.C. but it's not an overly punishing layout for the high handicapper. The 6,481-yard layout has a variety of different holes, giving it appeal for players of all skill levels and the manageable length makes it more approachable for beginners.",,,,,,,

The course has been around since the 1950s and has since matured into a challenging round. The greens are somewhat smaller than those you would find on a more modern golf course but the fairways are wide and player friendly. The greens will test your accuracy but they're not overly challenging. Meandering streams crisscross the golf course, cutting through fairways and running alongside some of the holes. There are also several ponds that come into play. In addition to the water, there are bunkers lurking along the greensides and fairways as well as a few strategically positioned trees. The Tawas Creek layout is challenging but playable, making it a great venue for golf tournaments and events.",https://www.golftawascreek.com/,,,,,,

1041,Betsie Valley Course at Crystal Mountain Resort,"Betsie Valley is one of two 18-hole championship golf courses at Crystal Mountain Resort in Thompsonville, Mich. When the second course, Mountain Ridge, was added, Betsie Valley also underwent a major renovation. The course retained its original playability but it was made more challenging to appeal to more advanced golfers. Both golf courses are spread across rolling hills covered with mature pine forests, encapsulating the best that northern Michigan golf has to offer. Although they share the same scenic landscape, the courses have a unique character as well as a different set of challenges. Betsie Valley's tight layout and small greens make it a true shot-maker's course. Many of the greens are also severely sloped, making them even more challenging. One of the toughest holes is the par-5 10th, which doglegs right and plays longer than the scorecard indicates.",https://www.crystalmountain.com/,,,,,,

The club was established in 1929, making it one of the state's older courses. The player-friendly layout has a traditional design that is on the shorter side, measuring to just over 5,900 yards from the back tees. The holes are fairly straightforward and there are no hidden hazards. The golf course does require a fair amount of accuracy though with mature trees lining the fairways. There are also strategically placed sand bunkers guarding most of the greens. It might not what you are looking for if you are searching for a formidable test, but it is great for a casual round. Riverdale Country Club is also gentle enough for beginners to approach with confidence.",https://www.riverdalecountryclub.com/,,,,,,

1168,Timberlane Country Club,"When Timberlane Golf & Recreation opened in 1959 as Timerlane Country Club, it was the first private golf club on the west bank of the Mississippi. The oaks planted at that time have beautifully matured, adding to both the scenery and difficulty of the golf course. Robert Trent Jones, Sr. designed the course, crafting a challenging test that has been ranked as one of the most difficult golf courses in the country. You'll have to contend with 80 strategically placed sand bunkers and 17 different water hazards. While the course is not overly punishing, you'll have to be prepared to have every aspect of your game tested. Before tackling Timberlane''s golf course you may find it helpful to warm up using the club's all-grass driving range and you can use the large putting green to practice with putting, chipping, and sand play.",https://playtimberlane.com/,,,,,,
