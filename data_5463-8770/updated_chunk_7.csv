6484,Raspberry Falls Golf & Hunt Club,"Raspberry Falls Golf & Hunt Club offers the traditional links course reminiscent of those found in the British Isles, situated amidst Virginia's horse country. The club gets its name from the land's former use, a raspberry field. The scenic terrain overlooks to Catoctin Mountains and there are still a few raspberry bushes dotting the course. By far the layout's most formidable challenges come from the deep, stacked pot bunkers that make it truly feel like a classic Scottish golf course. There are also water hazards on a few holes. The course's signature is the par-4 third hole, which is long but plays downhill all the way. The 10th hole, another par 4, is one of the toughest. The landing area is generous off the tee but there is a creek and pond to the left and fairway bunkers on the right.",http://www.raspberryfalls.com/,,,,,,

The second hole is one of southeastern Virginia's toughest golf holes with out-of-bounds to the left, trees to the right, and a sloped fairway that leads to a well guarded, double-tiered green. This par 4 is the no. 1 handicap hole at When Hell's Point Golf Club.",https://www.hellspoint.com/,,,,,,
