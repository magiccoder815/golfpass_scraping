9901,Kingsknowe Golf Club,"West of Edinburgh, Kingsknowe Golf Club is easily reached by anywhere in Scotland thanks to the Edinburgh City Bypass. The 1902 Open champion Alec Herd originally designed the golf course. It was later redesigned by none other than James Braid. It is a parkland golf course laid above and within valleys of hills that roll gently - and on the ground where Oliver Cromwell gathered his army gathered to bombard Redhall Castle in 1650.These hills define the Kingsknowe Golf Club's beautiful fairways, lined by cherry trees that require clever golfers to launch their balls to heavily guarded - and comparatively small - greens. The course features many difficult dogleg par-4s, and claims as its marquee hole the 460-yard par-4 16th.After wrapping up on another of the Kingsknowe Golf Club's par-4s, the 297-yard Hame, retire to the restaurant and watch others battle the green.",https://www.kingsknowe.com/,,,,,,

The organic evolution of the golf course has provided a unique layout that is one of the area's ""must-plays."" There are no par 5s and only two par 3s, which are balanced by short but interesting par 4s, a half dozen blind shots, and four consecutive seaside holes that represent some of the best golf in Fife. Golfers are quickly thrown into the golf course's challenges with the opening hole, which requires a tricky blind shot over a hill some 50 yards off of the tee. The prevailing winds coming in from the Firth of Forth add another formidable element to the game.",https://www.golfhouseclub.co.uk/,,,,,,

Over the years, Gullane has hosted the British Boys Championships, the Youths Championship, the Scottish Strokeplay, and the British Ladies Championship.The first hole, a fairly benign par-4, requires only a solid drive and a short iron for the approach. Don't get false confidence: the second might be the course's hardest, with a tight tee shot, uphill-all-the-way play, and frequent wind. Take in the view of the village of Gullane from the 17th tee, and finish off the 350-year-old golf course.Gullane Golf Club welcomes more than 30,000 visiting golfers per year, and the clubhouse provides ample refreshment; for bar food and a pub vibe, hit up the nearby The Auld Clubhouse.",https://www.gullanegolfclub.co.uk/,,,,,,

The math is a little fuzzy, though, because the club has been at Pitfirrane since 1953.The current golf course was designed by architect J.R. Stutt. He played loose with the length, giving Dunfermline five par 5s and five par 3s, an unusual combo that gives the golf course lots of variety from hole to hole. In fact, on the front nine, no par is repeated twice, a streak that isn't broken until No. 10, which starts a string of three par 4s.The most taxing stretch, unless you have a booming driver, has to be the final five holes, start at No. 14, called ""West Lodge,"" a 381-yard par 4. You have to drive left to avoid a big tree on the right. The green is surrounded by trees also. No. 15 is a 479-yard par 5 called The Pentlands.

The inward 9 holes carry fewer hazards but the Findon burn continues to create problems at the fifteenth and eighteenth.Arguably the fifteenth is the 'signature hole' of the course. First, the tee shot has to be accurate to cope with the right to left dog leg and then the approach shot, from a down hill lie, has to carry the Findon burn which, moat like, guards the entrance to the green. The par 507 yd par 5 eighteenth is a challenging closing hole featuring a drystone dyke on the left running all the way from tee to green with the risk of out of bounds with even' shot. The Findon burn. 1(K) yards short of the green creates a further dilemma of second shot selection; to carry or not to carry.Senior golfers and visitors normally play the shorter par 70 'Blue Tee' course.Course development has seen the planting of around 21.000 carefully selected trees, restoration of drystone dykes. construction of stone bridges, new tees at several holes and a pond at the short fifth.
