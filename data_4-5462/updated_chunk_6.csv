2911,Cold Spring Country Club,"Cold Spring Country Club is situated halfway between Springfield and Worcester. Opened in 2010 in an effort to bring world class golf to western Massachusetts, the club has since garnered a local following. The par-71 layout is unique in that it has six par 3s and five par 5s. There are also some par 4s in the 450-yard range. The 6,521-yard length indicated on the scorecard can be deceiving since it feels much longer when you're playing it. The golf course has plenty of variety, including dogleg lefts, doglegs rights, short holes, and long holes. Thanks to its mountaintop locale, Cold Spring C.C. offers stunning views that are as diverse as the holes. The vistas from the elevated tees and greens stretch to the Berkshires, Connecticut, and Vermont. From the golf course's highest tee box on the par-3 10th, you'll have a panoramic view of central Massachusetts.",https://www.coldspringcc.com/,,,,,,

2988,Pine Hills Golf Course,"Pine Hills Golf Course is a championship course that was carefully carved from the beautiful North Woods located 30 minutes northwest of Shawano. The abundance of mature trees is the layout's defining characteristic. They shape the doglegs and line the fairways, making accuracy a necessity. There is also a surprising amount of elevation changes throughout that make the course even more challenging. The occasional water hazard comes into play but they do not pose a serious threat. Good course management is key but overall it is a playable round no matter what your skill level though it doesn't hurt to warm up on the club's driving range or putting green. Pine Hills G.C. location nestled within the forest may explain why it is still one of the best-kept secrets in central Wisconsin.",https://www.pinehillsgolf.net/,,,,,,

3006,North Shore Country Club,"North Shore Country Club sits along the Intracoastal Waterway, offering holes that play along the ocean as well as some that play inland weaving through coastal marshes and towering pines. The golf course blends seamlessly with the scenic surroundings. Strategically placed bunkers fiercely protect the greens and golfers should also be prepared for some tricky forced carries. The fairways are generous and forgiving though. The course is a fair test but it is especially tough on windy days. The interior, tree-lined holes contrast nicely with the waterfront holes and they have the added benefit of protection from the prevailing sea breezes. North Shore Country Club is a player-friendly layout that both beginners and seasoned players can enjoy, which is why it has become one of the Outer Banks' most popular golfing destinations.",https://www.northshoregolfcoursenc.com/,,,,,,
3008,Holland Hills Country Club,"Located in the Southtowns of WNY between Holland and Colden, Holland Hills Country Club is less than a half hour from Buffalo. The golf course sits atop the highest point in Erie County. From its lofty perch, the elevated tees offer views that stretch across acres of rolling countryside. The championship layout features a variety of challenges including tree-lined fairways, water hazards, and strategically placed sand traps. There are also a few sharp doglegs to watch out for. It's the many elevation changes though, which can range from subtle to dramatic, that are the true test of this golf course. Be prepared for several tricky uphill, downhill, and sidehill lies. From the tips, Holland Hills Country Club is quite formidable but multiple sets of tees make it more player friendly for all skill levels.",http://hollandhillscountryclub.com/,,,,,,

It's one of western New York's most accessible public golf courses. The course opened in 1930 as the first public nine-hole layout in LeRoy. The creation of the golf course was spearheaded by Orator Woodward, youngest song of Jell-O magnate Donald Woodward. He believed the landscape of rolling hills and meandering streams was the ideal setting for a round of golf. The natural contours of the terrain helped to determine the placement of the bunkers. Water comes into play on a few holes at LeRoy Country Club, most notably on the finishing two. A large lake on the 17th turns into a creek that wanders across the middle of the final par-3 hole.",http://www.leroycc.com/,,,,,,

The course has a classic parkland layout that plays across gently rolling hills. The fairways were cut through forests of mature hardwoods but they are wide and carefully sculpted to direct balls toward the middle. Skillful players could even try to use the contours to their advantage. Each hole has a bunkers but the bunkering is not excessive. In addition to the mounding and bunkering, the undulating terrain provides natural elevation changes. The golf course finishes with what is arguably its toughest hole. This monster par 5 is 620 yards from the back tees. It requires a drive over a ravine with a natural waste area to the left. Many consider it to be the toughest golf hole in northern Virginia.",https://www.golfoldhickory.com/,,,,,,

One of the trickiest holes is the par-3 third, which requires a carry over a massive lake to a small green. Although there are also mature trees lining the fairways, the holes are fairly straightforward. Beginners can approach this golf course with confidence but more advanced players will find it to be a fun casual round. The Gold Course is a better option for a tougher challenge.

3361,Shinnecock Hills Golf Course,"The course simply known as 'Shinnecock' remains an American classic. William Flynn's 1930s redesign of C.B. Macdonald and Seth Raynor's work has withstood the test of time. Shinnecock Hills, a par 70 of 7,440 yards, is the only course to host a U.S. Open in three different centuries - 1896, 1886, 1996, 2004 and 2018. Its wispy tall grasses waving in the wind give it the majestic look and feel of an inland links. Its rolling topography stands tall, even within golf's most exclusive addresses. The National Golf Links of America and Sebonack are famous neighbors on New York's Long Island.",https://www.shinnecockhillsgolfclub.org/,,,,,,

3419,Great Rock Golf Club,"Opened in 2001, Great Rock Golf Club is one of the newer golf clubs in Long Island but it feels much older thanks to its scenic landscape of rolling green hills covered with mature forests. The mountainous landscape provides plenty of elevation changes that make it difficult to find a flat lie. At 6,254 yards, the course is short but it is still a challenging round with narrow, tree-lined fairways that demand accuracy. There is hardly any water on the golf course but with strategically placed bunkers, sidehill lies, and towering trees to contend with, golfers will hardly notice the absence of water hazards. Great Rock's signature hole is the challenging 10th. This par-4 beast is a double uphill climb with a seemingly flat green, but if you read it that way, you're in for some trouble.",http://www.greatrockgolfclub.com/,,,,,,
