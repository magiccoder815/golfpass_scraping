It is a par-60 executive layout that offers the perfect level of challenge for beginners, juniors, and senior golfers. It is the sister course to Delray Beach Golf Club, a championship course that is less than a mile away. Opened in 1972, the golf course has a classic design that measures just over 3,000 yards. The terrain is mostly flat, making it an enjoyable course to walk. Despite its length the holes have the feel of a championship course. There are 14 par 3s, a fair share of which are quite challenging as opposed to the uniform par 3s you see on some executive courses. For more advanced players, it is a great place to get in a quick round of practice.",https://www.lakeviewgcdelray.com/,,,,,,

The course was designed to blend seamlessly into the natural setting while still testing your shot-making skills. You won’t find any man-made water hazards or artificial mounding on this golf course, instead you’ll be challenged by natural streams and ponds and mature evergreens. At first glance, the layout is seemingly wide open, but don’t let your guard down because the fairways are actually quite tight and many of them are strategically lined with trees. In keeping with the time it was built, the greens are smaller than those you would find on most modern golf courses and heavily protected by sand traps.
